# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**Audaris 'Audi' Blades** 


**Project Name: Relevant for Reddit** 


**Old or New: Existing Project**


**Team or Solo: Solo Project**


## Description

**Currently, my project takes in all of the script owners reddit api data. I'd like to expand the project to allow users to specificy alerts for subreddits. That way they'll be notified when a keyword they've specified is posted in the subreddits of their choice.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

- Combinging go and react together. I have an article that goes over the logisitics in doing so but it'll be the first time that I'm doing this.

- Changing reddit authentication scope from script level to user level. I have the documentation to view and since I already have some familiarity with the api and authentication in go I should be able to find the resources I need.

- Using react. I have used react a bit in the past before and spent the last week dilgently learning it. I'm confidient that I can implement it as a front end.

## Skateboard

**Allow user to allow relevant for reddit to access their information and display a list of their subreddits.**


## Bike
**Store user information and parse subreddits for keywords.** 

## Car
**Have full on logging and automatic interval parsing of subreddits. Along with a dashboard.**
