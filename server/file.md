They're all cold except for the last one with the nice lateral raise pump. Looking for criticism. I think I will one day compete.. obviously I am natural rn. I think I have what it takes.

I've been cutting since the beginning of the quarantine (mid-March) and I'm pretty satisfied with the results. The before pic is at my heaviest and since the cut was slow I've barely lost any strength.

Do you guys think I should keep cutting (maybe 5 more pounds)? Also, I know those estimates are not worth much but I'm still curious, what would you say my BF% looks like?

Finishing a cut, feels like it’s been a long, slow process. I started working out seriously a few years ago when I weighed 230 and felt like crap. The hardest part might be eating enough to add more weight, I’ve been eating at a deficit for so long it’s all I know now.

I didn’t really lose any weight this week or see significant change but I’m posting anyway because I it’s good motivation!  Lord knows that I wanted to have some ice cream but I chose a home made popsicle made of fresh fruit instead.  Thanks for keeping me on track fellow redditors!

 Are my back/shoulders underdeveloped?

[Me right now](https://imgur.com/a/JXH13gu) (underwear warning)

[Me two years ago (underwear)](https://imgur.com/a/04DBwkJ)

I have to admit that it took me a while to muster up the courage to make this post and ask for honest feedback. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and reply.

I used to be pretty consistent about eating healthy and working out, but I let myself go BIG time for the past 2 years. I am now in the process of trying to get to where I was, weight and strength-wise (I'm already 3 kg down, yay!).

My current stats:  
Male, 27  
H: 188cm / 6' 2"  
W: 94.1kg / 205lbs

I'm not gonna pretend like I used to be extremely muscular or anything, but I felt appropriately strong and healthy back then, apart from feeling confident about my body. That's not the case anymore, sadly. One thing that has been bugging me lately is how narrow my shoulders/back look compared to the rest of my body (especially since my legs have always been quite thick). I do realize that this is certainly exacerbated by my weight gain, especially around the waist/belly. However, I can't help but feel self conscious about the perceived narrowness/disproportion, especially since all of my weight gain goes straight to my waist and thighs, making me look even more pear shaped.

Am I too in my head about it? Should I just keep losing weight and lifting as hard as I can, or should I give some special attention to my back and shoulders?

<td>Comment contains lifting: 
 As I increase the weight I’m capable of lifting I feel like the volume I can do in one workout is going down drastically. Is this normal when increasing strength? Should I slow down and wait to “grow into” the weight I’m at before I continue increasing. To clarify my form is good and I can do the amount of reps I would at the lower weight, I just end up doing less individual exercises before feeling beat.

 I can't find a \*clear\* answer to this anywhere, wondering if anyone here can give me a hand?

Here is where I am at with my backbend:  
[https://imgur.com/V3s3eyd](https://imgur.com/V3s3eyd)

I can't seem to get my arms to straighten. I've managed to fix my feet (so they don't point out as seen above) and I'll try to push my chest forward and out/up (I can see in the pic I'm swaying the wrong way), but my elbows are still locked tight.  
I'm not sure what the issue is. I think it may be a combination of shoulder flexibility and arm strength, but I'm wondering if anyone can confirm? Also if anyone can give me any exercises and/or stretches to focus on so I can improve my backbend?

Thanks so so much!

 I have a simple question. My current routine is cardio - running in the morning (4 miles) and strength training in the evening at home using dumbbells. I also practice intermittent fasting and eat in evening, before and after exercise. I usually take casein before I go to bed.

 Any tips for helping minimize DOMS? 

I just returned to working out this week. I’m doing a 3 day split to start (Day 1: Chest/Triceps/Shoulders/ Abs. Day 2: Legs. Day 3: Back/ Biceps/ Abs.) The DOMS between the Day 1 and Day 2 did not really impact each other. I do feel the DOMS from leg day is going to have an impact on my deadlifts for back day. Also, Leg DOMS impact my ability to walk at work.

 Wendler during some templates (like BBB) talks about extending a cycle to 4 weeks with 3 weekly training sessions instead of 4, like:

Week 1: SDB  
Week 2: OSB  
Week 3: DOS  
Week 4: BDO

I'll start having less time in the gym going forward (both per workout and number of workouts), but like the nature of doing one focused BB lift per workout and then the three assistance categories.

Doing 531 like that (or going EOD) with the recommended full-body assistance, will there be a significant difference in progress?

 Two questions about the Reddit PPL program's pull day:

1) If I'm starting off as a novice right now (155 lbs), is it reasonable to expect this program to be able to take me to DLing 3 plates? Asking since other beginner programs like SS and SL have you DLing on average 1.5 times a week, 50% more for more gains. 

2) Would it be overkill to add trap bar shrugs and T bar rows as well to both or at least one of the pull days? Any idea what a reasonable rep/set scheme would look like for both lifts in this program?

 Does Cardio affect my weightlifting later that day?

I usually go for an hour and a half long walk in the evening after my weightlifting that day.
I once read that cardio before lifting weight will result in not being able to lift as much weight as you could if u did not walk/ do cardio.

Now after doing that for the last 3 Months I ask myself is that even true? Will that walk in the morning result in me lifting less than I would lift usually?

 How much will boxing rounds impact recovery when my main goal is hypertrophy and strength?

I usually run/spin/cycle for cardio however having come from a fighting background of jiu jitsu I was wanting to incorporate some sort of Punching and kicking work into my routine for cardio but also to do some explosive training, plus having some power behind my punches will only serve to help me better with my self defense which was why I jumped Into jiu jitsu in the first place...plus I think it would jsut add something new and fun to my training.

I currently do full body workouts focusing on strengths and hypertrophy  but I was wondering how much boxing rounds on a heavy bag would impact my recovery 

My week
Monday - rest
Tuesday - full body resistance
Wednesday - cardio
Thursday - full body resistance
Friday - rest
Saturday - full body resistance
Sunday - cardio 

Lets say I place boxing rounds as one of my cardio would I be alright or is it going to take too much out of my upper body? I've never touched a heavy bag so that's why I'm asking

 Ok with HIIT: its high intensity. You can not exercise at high intensity for long periods of time, not unless youre on something or at an athlete level

I wouldnt suggest HIIT for 30 min, but instead break it into 2 15 min sessions. Or 20 min sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening perhaps. The intensity of a longer session is not going to be up there, as fatigue will naturally set it. But by breaking it up, you should alleviate this problem. This could also be done with a ten min break in between. A Conservative amount of caffeine before hand may also be a benefit.

If youre feeling 'ready to die' (in the good, post workout sense, not the 'I'm gonna have a heart attack' way I hope), then that's fine, I would not push past that without a rest. 

Also be aware of your bodys natural adaption plateau: if your TDEE is 2500kcal, snd youre at 2300 (after food and exercise), eventually your tdee will drop to close to 2300, so you'll have to eat less food. Consume 2000. Then your tdee drops to that and you drop food again (don't go below 1600 though, though you're not at that point yet !). Its possible that by dieting and your inclusion of HIIT, you've lost enough weight to make further loss slow: simply lower your calories a bit more. 

Your body will also resist losing weight after a while too, our bodies are masters of adaption. When building muscle, its a good idea to give your body a restz so well often have a week or month of maintenance. The same can be said for weight loss. Stop trying to lose weight for a week or two (make sure you don't put more on though), then after that begin to increase your deficit again. This allows your body to balance out and 'reset' so to speak, and you may even find progress is quicker here too.

It may also be a good idea to incorporate resistence training, too, as the energy that burns is a double whammy: first by lifting weights, you burn a huge amount of calories. Second, your body will use energy to recover the next day. 
I'm a firm believer that HIIT and resistence are the vest ways to lose weight - more so than steady state cardio

As you're apparently fairly new to regular HIIT, dobt try to run before you can walk. Forget that 30 mjn for now. If you struggled with 5 or ten min, then do that for a couple of days or a week, then increase it to 15. Then the next week to 20. Then to 25. Dont try to do too much at once for 2 reasons:
1) youll burn out, end up hating it, feel like crap, and end up cheating (eother executing exercises poorly)
2) you'll give yourself nowhere to go. Same with calorie deficits: start small and make amall adjustments. Drop calories down from 3000 to 2900. Then increase your exercise. Then drop calories again 100-200. Next, incrwase your calories burned etc etc 

Patience, determination, dedication, strong will, and proper planning. You cant eat an entire pizza in 1 mouthful, and the same is true about losing weight.

Motivation: be focused on your goal and why you want it. How bad do you want it? Anyone you know that has succeeded in this? Or a significant other who you want to make their jaw drop, or maybe adding 10 years to your life for your kids....

Take progress pics. Let me tell you as soon as you see the physical difference, you'll start to become your own motivation, your own inspiration. After I cut for the first tine and got to almost 10%BF, could see my abs and the muscle separation in my chest, that was it; i became my own driving force. Let me tell you, if you look at yourself, and feel that feeling of accomplishment, and feel that drive to go at it harder, you become one powerful force in your own life. You'll be unstoppable. 

240 to 200 is not to be sniffed at. You're already there.

<td>Comment contains strength: 
 Don't exert yourself at first. Swap HIIT cardio for less strenuous efforts. Lower the intensity to increase the time spent on the elliptical, so you get used to the effort and the routine. It is not easy, mentally and physically, to go HIIT every time you step on a cardio machine. Honestly I know that if I had to go HIIT every time I run and push my heart over 150 BPM I would probably never run. Instead I take it like a stroll and go on from here. Once you start moving you can push yourself if you feel it. I think it better to create a long lasting routine.

Remember we all start somewhere. When I entered the gym at 18 I once got trapped under a 65 lbs barbell on the bench press. Now I rep 225 lbs. Cardio is like strength it builds up over time.

You already did great, like literally doubling your cardio time. Enjoy this phase while it lasts because once the fast newbie gainz are over your performance will increase ever so slightly.

As for the enjoyment, again: it builds up over time. Your body gets used to it, it becomes a habit, you enjoy your progression, eventually you become good and it makes you feel great.

Keep it up!

 Hey wanderlust! I have a little experience here. Honestly every body is different and every body needs more/less time to adjust to working out so I can't give you a specific time that you will get to 30 MIN HITT. Buttttttttt.... I would like to encourage you that it does get easier, when I lost my weight I wanted to die after my walks/runs for a solid 2 or 3 weeks. I would get home and just crash. I couldn't work out in the morning or else I was worthless throughout the day. I think it was about week 4 that I realized that I was getting stronger and was actually looking forward to running/lifting. After about 3 or 4 weeks I was able to tell how low my energy was if I didn't work out which was motivating.

Speaking of motivation, use your people around you. If you don't have anyone to keep you motivated you can always message people on /r/fitness, for the most part we are fairly cool people that want people to hit their goals. For me I would listen to youtube Arnold Schwarzenegger motivational videos and as cheezy as that is it worked. The key is to find a reason to want to change and hold onto that, for me it was a break up but for you it could be health, wanting to look good, family, or whatever. Grab onto that and try to think about it as often as you can throughout the day.

 That’s very impressive to lose 40 lbs just through dieting. There’s a lot of good advice already in this thread, and I would second the folks who recommend you lift weights. I went from 237 last March to 172 now, and the biggest change in my body occurred when I started lifting weights. You don’t have to bulk up, and you probably won’t gain much muscle if you control your diet, but your body will begin to tone itself in a really cool way.

 Now, I'm different because I lost the weight a while ago, and I've lost a few pounds and gotten into fitness again recently.

I started out with just basic cardio. Warmup, run for a while, cooldown. Warmup, run longer than last time, cooldown. This worked to a degree, then I started running outside opposed to a treadmill, which feels easier to me to hold a comfortably heavy pace. Then I started alternating runs: sometimes I'd run to set a speed record, sometimes I'd run to get a longer distance.

Now I sometimes do HIIT as well. I think alternating has helped me improve a ton, but I'm also far ahead of where I've ever been for my cardio and strength.

I guess I derailed. I wasn't able to run 10 minutes at 6mph when I started back up. It took a while to build up to distance running. 12 minutes at 6, 15 minutes at 6, I remember being so excited about 25mins at 6mph.

I just ran a 5k (3.12mi) in 25:30, while my goal is 25 mins. I guess my point is: progressive overload... always do a little more than you did last time.

 By far two biggest things I’ve learned in my 10+ years in fitness:

1. You can NEVER out-train your diet. You should absolutely celebrate that you’re already exercising,  you’re ahead of everyone who isn’t. After you build this habit though, not getting your diet down is like buying a luxury car and putting bald tires on it. Even the highest intensity workouts will not make up the difference of over eating by a few hundred calories, and under eating will result in your body burning muscle for fuel. Restrictive dieting and tons of cardio rarely gives the results people expect. Eating properly before a work out will also make a HUGE difference in how you feel during. 

2. Lift, lift, lift. Cardio and HIIT training should compliment resistance training. The biggest fitness myths are that you can spot reduce fat (like doing sit-ups to burn fat around your core), and that lifting weights will make you look like a big bulky bodybuilder. Do not be afraid to lift weights, and do movements for the rest of your body, not just your arms.

 By far two biggest things I’ve learned in my 10+ years in fitness:

1. You can NEVER out-train your diet. You should absolutely celebrate that you’re already exercising,  you’re ahead of everyone who isn’t. After you build this habit though, not getting your diet down is like buying a luxury car and putting bald tires on it. Even the highest intensity workouts will not make up the difference of over eating by a few hundred calories, and under eating will result in your body burning muscle for fuel. Restrictive dieting and tons of cardio rarely gives the results people expect. Eating properly before a work out will also make a HUGE difference in how you feel during.

 Motivation comes and goes, so even if we give you a bit here you're still going to be stuffed the next time it goes. Look instead towards habit forming and self discipline. Don't be afraid to try different exercises and routines, you should really be looking for something you can see yourself doing for the rest of your life.     
     
By the way weight loss is really a food based endeavour. Exercise can help marginally but it's more about strength, mental health and cardiovascular health than weight loss. If you're not losing weight, or if you're gaining weight, you need to change what you're eating.

 Man I die for “a bit” after walking up stairs. At 190 I deadlift 495 for 6 bench 225 close grip
For 8 and squat 525 don’t compare your cardio capabilities to your success. The fact you’re dripping sweat is a good thing- some people can run a mile and not break a sweat,
Are they even working?? Nope. Do it dude, keep doing it, and after you think you’re done? You’re only 40% finished - David goggins. I’d give every one of my lifts to go back to when I couldn’t do 10 push-ups.

 Will squats and increasing my leg strength help with my 3 mile time?

I just started weightlifting again this week and squatted today before running 3 miles a few hours later and it felt like absolute hell.  Improving my run time is a big priority for me right now so I’m wondering if I should just skip leg days for the time being if it doesn’t help with my run time, because it really hurt my run performance today.

 Looking for some critique to my current work out. I've tried a few different ones, I've taken bits I liked and combined them into one. I'm mostly trying to tone my upper body (arms, chest, stomach), but also keep everything in good shape. This is my current work out.

15 squats  
15 crunches  
15 split lunges  
15 mountain climbers  
30 sec plank  
30 sec superman  
30 sec wall sit  
10 pushups  
15 leg lifts  
10 ab twists

10 bicep curls  
10 overhead press  
10 tricep curls  
10 behind the head (idk name)

Repeat 2X  
I also learn dance routines and dance on average 2-3 hours a week. Weekends I also sometimes 10 min jog.

 Need a lifting routine recommendation please.  I have a smaller set of dumbbells, maybe 30-35 lbs max, and something that would work for a flat bench (for benchpress or similar).  I also have a few pulleys I can rig up in the barn for pull-downs, seated rows, etc.  I'm out of work so I'm looking for a decent amount of volume and either a 5-day split or something that can make the most of my time off.  My previous routines were barbell and gym-equipment heavy so trying to modify them to fit isn't working.  Thank you!

 Female, 24, and have been lifting weights for about 4 years (last 2 years more serious). I have a question about “saddlebags”. I’m sure everyone knows what they are. I’ve been doing more research on them and I know it’s likely fat. And I know the only way to reduce fat is cardio. But omg I cannot shake these off. From what I read it also seems like it’s because my glutes are like sagging into my sides. So should I do more glutes? My overall body physique is probably more muscular than most girls. So like I’m not new to lifting or not just starting out. I don’t have a lot of stubborn fat places, especially for weight 141lbs. I eat good. Occasionally cheat meal weekend. I have a split I follow. I do legs 1-2 a week. A lot of squats and RDL. And hamstring curl. Split squats. Should I incorporate more glute? Usually quad dominated exercises I suppose. I totally get that I can’t spot reduce fat and things take time. But omg I’ve been struggling with this part of my body probably since high school.

5x5 OHP

3x15 Lateral Raise

5x5 Concentration Curls

5x5 Reverse Bicep Curls

5x5 Hammer Curls

5x5 Bent Over Rows

(Repeat for eternity)

Sometimes I do hip thrusts and abs but I’m not as consistent, I’ve been doing this for the past few months and I’ve made a lot of progress. I was doing 3x12 on all of them but have been changing it up recently. Also does it really matter if I use neutral grip on stuff like floor press or OHP or would I be hurting chest progress a lot?

 Im hyper mobile in my elbows and have a lot of problems with locking in my elbows when I’m exercising, anything strenuous like planking or heavy dumbell lifts etc I was told this is because my surrounding muscles are too weak and my arms are defaulting to that to push through, does anyone else have this problem? How did you break the habit of locking in? I think it is the reason why I haven’t progressed much in the last year with arm strength.

 Hi,

I have been lifting for 1.5 years whilst doing a decent amount of cardio ( three times a week 30 min sessions) . I have just been following what my friend has been doing who has been going to the gym for 5 years. However, I'm not seeing the size and strength results I wanted. My arms are fuller and I've got a bit wider but that's it and I feel like I have wasted my time.

I am 5ft 7 and 62 kg

My 1 Rep max:

Bench Press - 80 kg

Squat - 70 Kg

Deadlift - 110kg

Overhead Press - 50 kg

I would like to follow the reddit push pull legs routine but I am wondering if I should do an intermediate one as I don't think I'll get as much gains and progress as fast?

Thanks

 The Scottish Government have just said gyms *might* reopen mid-September, having been shut since March. Pubs are already opened though so if you want to get drunk that's fine but if you want to lift weights, definitely not! We've had 0 new deaths for two weeks now and new cases are consistently low, plus gyms have spent all that time and money implementing safety measures like installing cleaning stations, spacing out equipment, etc.

Right before the gyms shut, I was just starting to see my numbers go up again after months of stagnation. I'd finally got into a decent morning routine going before work and was going consistently instead of skipping days all over. At least the lockdown has forced me to work on my cardio (from 0 to running 10K) but I just want to see gains again ;_;

 In January I started to cut my weight down from 155. I made it down to 138 and my weight loss has stalled. I've gone all the way down to 1200 calories per day, and I track every thing that I eat and drink. I cannot get below 138 and I don't understand why. I lift weights and run 1 or 2 miles 3-4 times a week, and I do MMA classes 3-4 times a week for 2.5 hours. I need to get down to 125 for a fight in November and I'm genuinely stuck.

 Two things, one is a rant kinda and the other is kinda not, but I don't wanna make another post.

As a dude with skinny legs, I never had the issue if my thighs rubbing together. Now that it's almost been a year lifting, and I go harder on leg day than the others, they are rubbing together and I don't like it! The friction is real and some bs.....still love lifting though. (Actually going to be a third thing now)

Did ab abducters, least I think that's the term, and omg my inner thigh is killing me right now.

I love lifting, glad I got into it and wish I gotten into sooner. But there's a part of me, possibly the logical part, that's is wondering why I make myself sore. To be sore for a day or two. And then!!! On the day I'm no longer sore, to hit that part again. I do 6 days a week and loving it. But as it goes. Chest back legs repeat rest. Chest is sore, but not like my inner thigh soreness right now but that odd feeling (you know what I mean), on back and leg days. Next chest day feel great and I just decided to do it again! It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous and makes no damn sense, but I'll keep doing it because it also makes me feel good. Strange thing this lifting.

Also found out my back squat form was shit after recording a set, so now I am box squatting for a while in an effort to fix it. 

Basically, I have been deceived all this time because my body fat is in areas where muscle should be, giving my body the illusion of strength. Nice.

 I'm new to lifting in gyms since two weeks. I'm not new to fitness and have had a decently active lifestyle with hiking, biking, and about six months of calisthenics. 

My question is about legs and how to structure leg day, how hard to push. I've been going to the gym following one of the PPL routines and like everyone says, my last reps are very close to failure. 

The problem is that I can push my legs to such an extent that if I push to failure I will be completely unable to walk the day after. After my first leg day at the gym I have decided that push legs to failure is not really a great idea. 

I'm thinking of just doing a progression where I don't focus as much where failure is and what my maxes are but instead focus only linear progression only. 

Is this wrong, should I push my legs to failure even though I have this problem? Or is just increasing weights linearly and not worrying too much on working to the last rep good enough? My legs have always been strong for my weight, but most of my legs got a lot of endurance.

 How do I know when it's time to deload? I've been more consistent than ever hitting 34/35 workouts in the last 7 weeks. My program has me doing 2-3 9-10 RPE sets per workout.   
Why I feel like I should deload; My body is aching, my neck hurts, my quads hurts, my ankle hurts, my shins hurt, my cardio is dead in the water. I feel wake up feeling like i've just finished at the gym.  

Why I think I might be being a little bitch about it; My programs last set per big lift is an amrap set, sometimes it's a triple sometimes it's an 8 rep set, depends on the exercise. The guidance I have for deloading is to wait until that last set is 1x&lt;Prescribed Reps&gt; at 9-10 RPE. Currently I'm still hitting prescribed reps plus 1-2 meaning my RPE is 7-8 for my top set. Means I'm below the fatigue guidance for deloading.

Am I leaving gains on the table by listening to my body and deloading now? Am I just being a little bitch who is too afraid to lift heavy?

 Anyone else feel like beginning of workout is hardest part? (Or one of the harder parts)

So I consider myself pretty fit definitely cardio wise since for the past few months I’ve been training for Ironman. But I’ve taken up CrossFit workouts recently, and while I know my strength is my weakest link right now is it normal for me to be the first one out of breath profusely sweating? Like once I get past that initial hurdle I feel like I can keep going for days once I get in a rhythm is that normal thing for endurance athletes?

Since quarantine started, I started lifting weights with a home set that's been in my house as long as I can remember. However, I've noticed that my right arm has gotten noticeably larger/more muscular then my left arm. This can't be normal or healthy right? Since I'm challenged vertically and horizontally when it comes to space, I've only been sticking to bench press and bicep curls for exercises. For bencing, I normally do 60lbs (plus whatever my bar weighs), and for bicep curls, I've been alternating between 20 and 15lbs (again plus whatever the weight alone weighs). I don't think it's a form thing as I sure as fuck feel it in both arms (just did 4 sets at 15lbs with 10 15 15 10 reps). I never do anything on my right arm that I can't already do on my left arm, so I'm confused as how this is happening. While I have been using my right arm for basically everything in life, I still don't think this looks right (my left arm has increased in size since I've started) The only thing I can think of is that I'm not spacing my arms out properly when bench pressing. We have marks on the bar, but it's so old that I may be fucking up and not knowing it. Any help/advice would be appreciated :)

 After fixing my form and using leg drive I’m benching 225x5 most recently (really about 225x8 on a good day). This is a 20lb increase just bc of form. I’m trying to hit a goal of 275 for max. I’m cutting, but still gaining strength on my lifts. What time frame would be reasonable for that goal? I understand cutting slows it.

It’s a PPL split but it follows the nsuns format for the big compound lifts. The only issue I have is the first leg day where it has 8 sets of squats. That sounds like hell. Am I just being a wimp or should I switch it with another exercise?

 I'm 15, 6'0 and a bit less than 170, I've been on a weight loss journey for a while now and I've lost over 70 lbs and I want to lost around 10-15 more , but recently I've been feeling like I'm doing too much in my exercise routine and I wanted to get some advice and see if what I'm doing is normal or do I need to cut some things out, and if i do, how can I cut it out and still continue to lose weight, so my current schedule is:

-Wake up at 9 am

-Go on an hour and a half walk/run around my neighborhood

-Get on exercise bike for 20 minutes

-Break my fast at 1 pm (I usually eat about 1400ish calories throughout the day)

-1 hour weightlifting session along with 100 push ups 

-5 min HIIT session

-Before dinner have a small workout session that consists of 180 crunches, 7 minutes of yoga, chin ups, 6 minute hiit, and some small exercises

-After dinner get on the exercise bike for 20 minutes

-Start fasting at 7 pm

Then I just enjoy the rest of the day, also I'm not completely sure if this is the right subreddit, i dont use reddit often, so if im one the right one please point me in the right direction, thank you!

 Hi guys, I am working out 5 times per week maintaining the same workout schedule of weight lifting. I have slight love handles and belly fat I want to get rid of. I'm in the process of bulking up and try to maintain a healthy diet as much as possible. I've seen this Jeremy Ethier video of using cardio to lose belly fat so I was wondering is it possible to lose belly fat WHILE bulking up muscle mass (which I intend to do by following a strict low-calorie high-protein diet).

I could do 10-20 minute cardio workouts prior to my weight lifting and I could rely on a low-calorie high-protein diet right?

 I always struggled with barbell lifts, especially squat and deadlift. I've just read guides about the "Big Three" from Stronger By Science. There are some progressions you can follow there that allow you to learn the movement and make sure you do it with correct form. For example to learn the back squat you first perform goblet squats, then move on to front squats and finally move on to back squats. Similarly with deadlift: kettlebell/dumbbell hip hinge -&gt; RDL -&gt; Deadlift. Do you think it's a good idea to replace the original squat / dl with these exercises for now until I get some more body awareness and improve form / flexibility?

&amp;#x200B;

If yes then do you think it's viable to perform these exercises in the same workout? Normally you'd rather avoid squatting and deadlifting in the same workout because both exercises would use a lot of the same muscles so your performance would be hindered. But wouldn't front squat and RDL avoid this problem by being more quad / hamstring specific respectively and therefore being reconcilable in the single workout?

 Obviously machines are inferior to free weights in most aspects for reasons known to everyone. But I'm wondering - does it make any sense to use them while you're learning barbell lifts? For example using chest press machine to increase pushing strength while you're learning form using relatively low weight and higher reps with barbell? Or is it counter-productive and I'm better off concentrating on barbells exclusively, perhaps using machines later on as additional accessories / isolation volume?

 My wife created a PPL program for me, she finished and acquired a certficate III in fitness from Australian Fitness Academy.

Yesterday's push workout was:

Bench Press 10/8/6/6/4 | 60/70/80/80/85kg

Clean and Jerk = 10x3 | 40kg

Arnold Press = 10x3 | 16kg per arm (kettlebell)

Diamond Pushups = 10x4

Buso Plank = 60 sec x 4

Inclined one hand push up = 10x1 per side

ending with Burpees, push jacks, box jumps 10x3 each

&amp;#x200B;

I was criticizing her push routine as I am against putting a clean and jerk after doing a bench press, as well as the lack of dips. She mentioned that the clean and jerk was meant to be a break after the bench press. I don't have any certificate but I've been lifting long enough to be familiar with the PPL split.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts.

 There is no particular feeling you should feel, I've been lifting for 5 years. Most of the time I feel energised and good. 

Other times i have felt anywhere from f***ing amazing euphoria to deflated and feeling like I wasted my time going to nearly fainting.  

Ir just depends on what is going outside the gym/nutrition. Don't think about how you should feel, just do the work and get out.

 I'm interested in knowing if a chart, excel spreadsheet, graph, or simple infographic exists for showing the potential strength and cardio gains for consistent exercise throughout the years.

For example, this data exists for people who invest X amount of money beginning at 20, 30, and 40 years old. The calculator will calculate the amount of interest earned if you start putting away $400/month at age 20, and how much it will grow with interest earned at age 50.

Does something like this exist for fitness? I'd like to know what a 33-year-old with specific bench/deadlift/squat stats could potentially achieve if he continued a 2-3x week routine for 5-7 years, or even more.

 16 Male, 6'2.

I want to start exercising, as I want to get into better shape. I started at 206 pounds.

Starting last week, I completely changed what I ate, going from microwaved burritos to chicken and green beans and eggs for breakfast instead of cereal.

I have also started jogging/running 30 minutes on a treadmill for 4.5 mph and on a rowing machine for another 30 minutes. Coming from not doing any physical activity, this has been extremely challenging but I can feel myself getting used to it (not getting sore anymore). 

At the end of each daily exercise, I do the workout listed in the "30 Day Six Pack" app, which is basically stretches, sit ups and planking. This lasts about 15 minutes. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I have proper form as I am doing these alone.

I now weigh 196 pounds. Am I doing okay? Is there anything else I should be doing? I would really like to increase my upper body strength but I have no access to dumbells. 

Should I make any changes to my exercises? I have a bad habit of eating at night, which I should probably stop. 

I look forward to your guy's responses.

 Had an issue recently that I wanted some advice on. I've been going to the gym sporadically for the past 9-10 months without ever going consistently more than twice a week. Recently I've been wanting to get more serious about lifting now that I have more time on my hands to focus on it.

A few days ago, I was doing 5x5 deadlifts at 235 lbs (I'm 160). I managed to finish the sets though they got progressively more difficult and on my last set, my form was very sloppy (not back rolling horrible but still pretty bad). 

I went to the gym yesterday and tried to do the same workout (after two days not deadlifitng, though I did a chest day after the other deadlift workout) but couldn't do it. I did five reps my first set but my grip ended up failing when I went to re-rack the bar and I only got one end on the rack. The second set, I got 4 reps in before gassing out. I dropped down to 225 and gave it another go, but I could barely do 3 reps before deciding to just end it. 

So now I'm wondering what should I do right now? Honestly, my form is not very great on deadlift and could still use some work but I also really want to progress on this lift. How much weight should I drop down from 235 to improve my form without feeling like I'm setting myself too far back by going too light?

I dropped down to 225 and gave it another go, but I could barely do 3 reps before deciding to just end it. 

So now I'm wondering what should I do right now? Honestly, my form is not very great on deadlift and could still use some work but I also really want to progress on this lift. How much weight should I drop down from 235 to improve my form without feeling like I'm setting myself too far back by going too light?

 Had an issue recently that I wanted some advice on. I've been going to the gym sporadically for the past 9-10 months without ever going consistently more than twice a week. Recently I've been wanting to get more serious about lifting now that I have more time on my hands to focus on it.

A few days ago, I was doing 5x5 deadlifts at 235 lbs (I'm 160). I managed to finish the sets though they got progressively more difficult and on my last set, my form was very sloppy (not back rolling horrible but still pretty bad).

 For context, I'm 25, around 154 lb, just a touch over 6ft and slim built. I've also got Psoriatic arthritis and asthma and quite new to keeping fit. Since the lockdown in March (UK) I've been doing two circuits (one strength, one cardio) around five times a week alongside skipping rope and lifting weights when I've been in the mood, prior to this I went swimming as this helped my joints.

Essentially, I feel like I'm getting bored or tired of it and not seeing the results I want, any good circuits, or any other exercises at home I can try?

For context, the circuits I've been is a 1 minute of the following exercises with a fifteen-second break, random order:

\-Jumping Jacks

\-Wall Sit

\-Push-ups

\-Crunches

\-Step-Ups

\-Squats

\-Tricep Dips

\-Plank

\-High Knees Running in Place

\-Lunges

\-Pushups with Rotation

\-Side Plank

\-Downward Dog Pushups

\-Arm Haulers

\-Side Knee Tucks

\-Diamond Pushups

\-Six Inch Hold

\-Hand Walkouts

\-Knee to nose

 

Any help would be great! Thank you in advance.

 So to preface my question: maybe I'm just being impatient or not understanding the science correctly, but I've read the multiple wikis, guides, and even the Muscle and Strength Pyramid. I've also watched a ton of YouTube videos (Jeff Nippard, Omarisuf, 3DMJ, RP, etc.) and listened to a bunch of podcasts on diet and nutrition. I've also been weight training since Fall 2018 with only minor breaks due to a tear in my quadratus lumburum (tiny muscle right above the gluteus minimus) and then quarantine.

I've done several cuts throughout 2019 and 2020. I am in no rush to compete or show off so I've been taking things slowly and taking breaks from cutting when life's gotten hectic and stayed at or close to maintenance during those periods of time. I've also tried to keep good data. I've been using a TDEE spreadsheet I found somewhere online since March, but before that tracked weight and macros on/off via the Samsung Health app. When cutting, it seems my TDEE estimate is +/-2150. This is based on almost daily macro tracking and weigh ins.

I'm finally trying to do some lean gaining/slow bulking. I started by going to my estimated maintenance of 2150, but have been gaining weight on those calories. I've been averaging 0.9 lb/wk of weight gain for 4 weeks\* on an average of 2147 calories per week\*\*. Now that same calculator is showing my TDEE at 1800 cal/day, which makes sense based on the weight gain. Am I just being impatient on seeing the initial weight gain level off (i.e. water weight, food volume, glycogen, etc) or has my metabolism changed? I'm also tracking my lifts, but I think it'll take me another few weeks to really know if I'm progressing on lifts or not since I just started training again at the beginning of the maintenance phase.

I think at the heart of it, the reason I'm concerned is because I thought after over a year and half of either cutting or maintaining, I was looking forward to being in a slight surplus. I've always had a big appetite and I'm tired of being hungry, but I if I eat to satiety I gain weight very quickly.

I tried to list all the factors I think may affect my issue but feel free to ask questions if I've missed something.

\*In case anyone is interested the weekly average weights are as follows. Week 1: 167.5, Week 2: 168.4, Week 3: 169, Week 4: 169.8.

\*\*Calories are as follows. Week 1: 2042, Week 2: 2174, Week 3: 2191, Week 4: 2213. I realize as I make this post this has been trending up so I'll try to stay closer to the 2150 mark again for a few weeks.

 Looking for a routine critique.

**Personal Details**
Male, 32, 5'7", 160lbs

**Relevant stats**
Turkish get-up: 5 per arm (10 total) with a 35lb kettlebell, 1 min rest between each

Run: 3.2 miles in 28 min

**Goal**
My goal is to be generally fit without dedicating a ton of time to training. I want to have a healthy cardio vascular system and be able to lift heavy things when I need to. I only care about aesthetics insofar as I want to have some muscle definition and don't want to be overweight or skinny fat, but health and strength are my real focus.

**Exercises**
20 burpees and 10 band dislocates to warm up

Mon, Wed, Fri:
Turkish get-ups - 10 (5 left, 5 right) @ 35lbs

Tues, Wed, Sat:
5k run

**Progression:**
So far, I have gone from 2 Turkish get-ups (1 each side) with a 35 lb kettlebell, to 10 get-ups (5 each side), with a 1 min rest between each. I hope to continue this progress until I hit 20 total, at which point I will start over with a 50 lb kettlebell. 

I began running with Couch to 5k, and now am running 5k 3 times per week. I plan to add some speed work along with weekly long runs, to improve my 5k, rather than targeting the 10k progression. 
 

If I attempt to continue to lift heavier kettlebells and run a faster 5k, do you think I will meet my goal of general fitness? It's an incredibly simple and relatively quick routine, but I'd love to hear about any glaring flaws or potential pitfalls that I'm not considering.

 Unless you are training to run with weight there honestly isnt much point in using a vest/ankle weights etc and even if you are the benefits are mostly becoming acclimatized to running with weight. It's going to make your run higher impact and generally speaking you want the majority of your runs to be as low impact as possible. Resistance does not build aerobic endurance, long periods of aerobic activity do. If you are looking to build strength you're much better off doing that work in the gym. Run slow, and run far.

 I do "speed walking" at home occasionally with 20-40 pound weighted vests on a hiking setting (variable incline mode). From what ive read weighted exercise is good if done correctly. Helps burn fat, helps with endurance, strengthens your cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. It certainly seemed to help me quite a bit while in lock down especially when it came to cardio and endurance.

Id say incorporate an elliptical or treadmill hike into your routine with a weighted vest.

 I’m going to go against the grain a bit here. Let me preface this by saying that as long as you love lifting, keep lifting. In fact, athletes of all types will benefit from lifting, even if they don’t love it.

That said, given your body type, I wonder if you will excel more at endurance sports. I found this out myself in my teens. I started with lifting, and I liked the changes to my physique, but I did hit a bit of a ceiling after a couple of years (in terms of muscle gained, anyway). Then, I tried running, and I was pretty good at it. In my early 20s, I switched to road cycling. I took a break from the gym, but in my early 30s, I picked it back up. I’m still visibly a bit more muscular in the upper body than some of the more pure endurance athletes, even in my late 30s.

The other thing is that endurance sports are easy to do in a socially distanced fashion.

 Do not make the same mistake as I did because I didn’t know any better, which was neglecting strength training for years in favor of trying to lose fat as fast as possible by focusing on cardio. It wasn’t until I started strength training that I started looking and feeling in shape. 

Do strength training now as often as you can with rest, cardio afterwards and on your rest days between training. You will lose fat while gaining strength and muscle especially as a beginner, given you are in a deficit which will be more easily achieved with being more active in general.

You may want to start counting calories to ensure you’re in a decent deficit, but more importantly tracking your macros making sure you’re eating a high protein diet which will be more conducive to both losing fat and gaining strength and muscle. (At least .8 gram of protein per pound).

As long as you are in a slight calorie deficient state, as was mentioned, you’ll burn fat. If you are not strength training your legs, start now.

 I wouldn't just look at cardio as a way to lose fat.  I'd treat it as a way to confer unique adaptations that you don't get as much of from resistance training.  So the question, as always, should be "what are your goals?" If you need to get stronger for your goals then focus on that and use cardio work to support that. If you need aerobic capacity, then up the cardio and maintain strength.

 You definitely need to have lower-body strength days (or I would actually personally recommend just have full body days and cardio days , since it seems like you like the split)

 I'm a big fan of full body routines, so my weekly schedule is M/W/F is my strength training days and Tuesday/Thursday are dedicated cardio days. I will go run or swim some days, other days I'll do some HIIT, it just all depends on what I'm in the mood for. It works for my work schedule. 

Also don't forget to throw legs into your routine! It sounds like you just do upper body, that is not ideal!

 Try throwing In compound exercises, squats, deadlifts, bench, pull ups.  Lose fat, gain muscle, weigh more after!

 If you're confused and don't know how to set your own exercises, try the Nike training app, and go to plans and follow one :)) 
it sets a mix of endurance and strength and all. you can also add runs to your plan. check it out its good for upto intermediate cardio / HIIT imo.

 I train for performance not aesthetics, so take my advice with a grain of salt. But I'm having my best results in both areas using a concurrent training plan (tactical barbell) that has me doing a 50/50 split. 3 days strength, 3 days conditioning. Lifting consists of progressive work with mostly compound movements, and my cardio works out to about 80% HIIT &amp; 20% LISS/week. 

Prior to, if I skewed the ratio more toward cardio I'd lose a little muscle tone over time, and if did more lifting than running I'd get a slightly bigger but softer look with a bit more pudge. Neither look was good enough for what I wanted. 50/50 is just right for me, ymmv. Now I'm a size I like but also have the veins along with a relatively visible set of abs. 


Diet-wise I like Dan John's philosophy of "eating like an adult". I essentially eat enough to support training (or a little extra) without really counting calories. Just 4 or 5 sensible/balanced meals a day including a postworkout shake or meal. Aside from putting the training days in it's very low maintenance and feels almost effortless. I never had much success with bulking &amp; cutting strategies or getting OCD with calories. With my current plan the results (more muscle, less fat, better performance) just shook out over time with consistency.

**Edit**: Forgot to add I do occasional 20-24 hour fasts, once every couple months, sometimes more sometimes less. Can't recommend it enough for all sorts of reasons including fatloss.

 Take a look at sprinters vs marathon runners. In my opinion if your goal is to have as much muscle and as little bodyfat as you possibly can you should prioritize strength training, but prefereably do cardio as well, just not for hours on end. The strength training will mostly target fast twitch muscle fibers, which in most people can grow the biggest. But cardio is still important. Some guys (mostly bodybuilders) will say cardio hurts their muscle growth, but it's not true. It takes a lot of cardio to start burning muscle, but let's say you run half an hour a day it will most likely not hinder gains unless you don't make up for it by eating more. If you don't overdo it cardio can actually help you get even stronger by increasing stamina (which can be a limiting factor when lifting heavy), optimizing heart and lung function and even helping you recover from strength training when using the worked muscles lightly during cardio sessions and increasing bloodflow to them.

 I'm a big fan of the upper/lower/cardio split. So you have an upper day, a lower day and a cardio day. Depending on how hard you cardio it can be like an active rest day or more serious. I also think that murph style workouts, worth a Google, are a great mix, but exhausting.

Also going to really recommend a leg day, focus on your butt/hips and you will find a lot of strength/power.

 For general health you should do 45-60 minutes of “cardio” (could be running, biking, swimming, walking,  hiking, sport like soccer or basketball, etc) every day. Mostly it should be easy, maybe once a week make it harder by going longer or faster.

You also need to strength train. Too many benefits to be ignored. Three times a week is fine, you could get away with two. If you love strength training you can do it more frequently. Your choice of style. Many great recommendations in the sidebar here.

If you do both of those and your diet is okay, you’ll be healthy. It’s that simple. Losing nagging fat may require a little more planning (nutrition is the key there) but it will be infinitely easier if you’re exercising regularly, your heart is healthy, and you have strong muscles.

Don’t forget to take care of your joints and to work on mobility/flexibility. It won’t burn fat  on its own but it’ll keep you moving comfortably and reduce injuries/aging effects down the road.

 I do both.   I fucked up my back a year ago so I lift pretty lightweight, but since quarantine started I really got into running.

On one day I lift around noon and then run an easy 2-3 miles in the evening.  The next day I do a full ab workout and then run 5-7 miles.  And I keep that on repeat.  

As long as you stretch and know whats in your diet, you can do whatever you want to do.

 I do a great Push - Pull - Legs routine with HIIT Cardio sessions at the end. Doing Cardio after lifting helps flush the lactic acid out of your muscles and helps alleviate soreness. 
The cardio I do usually depends on the day. For example, on “Pull” days I’ll usually use the rower and really murder the muscle groups I just trained. 
Every once in a while I like to dedicate a day just for either stamina training (jogging/cycling) or explosive training (power cleans, suicide sprints, box jumps, etc.)

 For me.  Just to lose weight and gain strength the biggest key is I eat right.   I do strength 3x a week.  Different muscle groups each day.   I walk/cardio 3 to 4 times a week.   If I need a recovery day I take it but walking an hour typically is something I can do 4x.

For the strength training I try to do a minimum of 5 to 7 exercises.  Light weights 5 sets 10-20 reps.   This makes the workout last 45 min to an hour.   When I do cardio I go for 45 min to an hour.   

This ratio works for me.

 Dissect your rep range and determine if you can go up in weight for a slightly less reps or need to drop weight and do more reps. A good rep range for really digging into burning calories is 12-15 while keeping the weight heavy. Another thing you can do is ditch the weights and try other training methods and you can burn more calories while building muscle and stretch all at the same time. As far as doing cardio, you can burn more nagging fat by doing anaerobic exercises. Like running sprints. Flat ground as fast as you can. Start off with 10x30m or so and work up to 100 meters and like strength training, increase your reps with that. For burning more fat, anaerobic training is definitely the way to go. 

As for ratio, do both every day. Learn new exercises opposed to typical bench press or upright rows or whatever and replace those with your new exercises. Spend 20 mins or so at the beginning of your day with cardio and then do strength training. Also, according to Dorian Yates at least, there’s been studies that show doing them both in the same day but at different times will yield better results. According to their studies most people are doing aerobic cardio for long durations and that is great but burns less calories while doing it - however the effects linger and you’ll have a heightened calories factor for a while after stopping. And while lifting weights, in an aerobic manner, you burn more calories while doing it but the there’s no heightened lingering factor. 

In summation, do both everyday.

 I've been running 40-50km a week, 3-4 1-hour long running sessions for many years. I also do compound exercises with long rest periods since the last 3 years. I think you do not need to do anything else to achieve ideal health and body if you don't take steroids. There is no way you won't look your best if you lift 2-3 times your body weight and can run a sub 20 min 5 km or sub 90 min half-marathon.

My mood has improved and I can wear shirts I've had tucked in my closet for a long time. For about a month or so now I have continued to make consistent gains in both cardio and lifting. My routines look a little like this: lifting chest (bench, dumbell workouts, abs), cardio (hiit), legs (squats, lunges, glute bridges, abs), cardio (running), back (deadlift, rows, shoulders, abs), cardio (hiit).  


I only do Hiit 2x's a week because one of my goals is to run better hence why I pick a day to do a 30 minute run around the neighborhood. Also, I absolutely HATE my Hiit and running days, but they have been helping my stability and in turn helping my lifts.

 Everyone should do some strength and conditioning, but it's up to the person to figure out what's right for them. The biggest thing is what keeps you motivated to keep doing it consistently several or more times a week.

 It sounds like you might need to balance your hormones slightly. If you do too much endurance training you may get a spike in cortisol which arguably might make it difficult to get rid of stubborn fat.

To build muscle also depends on numerous factors not just lifting weights but again, balancing your hormones plays a part. So eating *Cruciferous* vegetables like broccoli can help reduce estrogen and  pomegranate juice can help with testosterone levels.

Also protein is only one part of the equations as you also need things like potassium such as from leafy vegetables, beetroot etc.

So although you might be doing plenty of weight exercises it may be your diet that needs attention to acquire a hormone balance.

Also too much cardio might be exacerbating things rather than helping as you might expect. So moderate walking is probably all you need in terms of cardio as you burn calories but don't endure so much stress that spikes cortisol.

Also try doing compound exercises - 5 sets of 8 reps to failure (if you are not already).  


There's a video here about fat loss mistakes.

 The past week has been my most productive ever, from a fitness perspective. ([Screenshot of my Fitbit exercise tracking page.](https://imgur.com/ouheDtK)) 3 days of weight lifting (1.5 months in), alternating with 3 days of rucking as cardio (first week ever). 6 days total.

Beat my PRs/achieved progressive overload in every session. Even got a bit of pullup progression. What I'm happiest about is that even on days where I felt sleep deprived, sick, or otherwise unready for a workout, **I still put in the time**. In fact, first few days I was still recovering from gout in the foot.

Despite all the challenges and disadvantages, I still not only got good workouts in, I even managed to improve my performance. Granted, on some days I had to push my heart harder than it ever had; stamina is a not my forte, heh. I'm consistently blown away by how resilient the human body is to stress.

EDIT: Just to add my workout experience just now. Work pushed my workout session much later than I'm used to. I also did more walking beforehand to meet my daily step goal. And on top of that, I had to worry about live, below-eye level, fragile hazards (i.e. two new puppies) thinking it's a good idea to lick my feet while I'm lifting half my bodyweight. It was the hardest, most exhausting session I've ever had. Fitbit agrees: I hit 178bpm max HR in the first time ever AFAIK.

Despite this, I did manage to finish all my lifts and progress in each one. (Except my pullup progression, which is currently dead hangs. Saved it for the end of the session, but ended up with zero gas in the tank.)

 Started lifting in the beginning of July seriously and now I'm finally comfortable enough to wear a tank top! My arms have gotten bigger and a little more definition would be ideal. Haven't skipped a single day (aside from rest days) and only took 2 cheat meals and one was only a packet of fruit snacks. Feels pretty good to be consistent and recognize your progress :)

 Since going back to the gym, I’ve been getting calluses on my hands, especially on pull day. I was researching solutions and came across an article on The Art of Manliness explaining how to care for calluses and that bad grip technique is the root cause. I fixed my grip, and now I actually feel my muscles being worked on pull day. I can also lift more!

<td>Comment contains Powerlifting: 
 Luckily (Regrettably?) I read earlier this week about someone doing "Birthday Squats" which intrigued me.  Well, today's my birthday and to inaugurate my new  Powerlifting belt  I did 52 x 240 lbs. prior to my cardio work for the day.

Caveats:

Before the "Fitness Rules Lawyers" chime in I did *not* do these all in one set.  I'm old and I spent a significant amount of my years in the 300-400 lbs range, which takes a heavy toll on you knees, so I set a time limit of 26 minutes (half my age) to complete all the reps.

Mission Successful:

Ended up doing 54 squats (lost track at the end there) across 11 sets in 25 minutes, 48 seconds. 

Just for Kicks:

Wanted to see if 240 lbs was really about 80% or my 1RM according to current 1eRM, so I loaded up another 70 lbs.  Felt incredibly heavy and I was (only) able to do 2 half-squats.  Had to move on to my 30-minute routine so didn't want to use this time to "go for it", especially since I have my deload day 4 later today.

 Rate my stay-at-home workout plan (Dumbbells &amp; Cycling)

 Hi there, my wife and I are under a pretty strict stay at home policy due to some health issues. The positive is that we’ve set up a home gym and developed a workout addiction over the last few months. This is the first time in my life I’ve stuck with a real routine, and the home gym is such a big help.

Could someone please rate my program? I’ve been doing some variation for this in the last few weeks and have enjoyed it, but sort of made it up based on exercises I enjoy and what I feel like I can safely do without a trainer. I have been doing weight training with a trainer for 5+ years, but never seriously pursued a program.

Unfortunately, all I have is adjustable dumbbells and adjustable kettlebells, but they’re heavy enough to work for now (up to 50lbs / each). I am also pretty new to cycling.

I’m targeting 1.5h in the gyms most days. My primary goal is to lose weight while keeping some muscle definition, and I’m eating at around a 500cal defecit (after eating back my calories from cycling). I have a heart rate monitor, a cycling trainer and a cadence sensor, so I have a reasonably accurate (although not exact) idea of what my calories burned in cycling look like.

I’m hoping to lose 15-20lbs before increasing my caloric intake and doing a bulk. I’d like to keep the routine relatively similar throughout that process... as I am a creature of habit.

I am 5’10” 32M and 205lbs / 28% Body Fat, trying to get to 185 / 190lbs before bulking.

**Monday**

Cycle: 45m @ Medium Intensity

Weights: Chest Press (5x5), Seated Dumbbell Row (3x8), Seated Overhead Shoulder Press (3x8), Triceps Extension (3x8)

**Tuesday**

Cycle: 1.5h @ Low Intensity

Weights: REST

**Wednesday**

Cycle: REST

Weights: Two-Kettlebell Squats (5x5), Two-Kettlebell Deadlifts (5x5), Resistance Band Bicep Curls (3x8)

**Thursday**

Cycle: 30m Interval Training, or 45m @ Medium Intensity if my legs are tired

Weights: REST (Sometimes I move Wed to here depending on how I’m feeling)

**Friday**

Cycle: 30m Interval Training if you didn’t do it on Thursday or REST

Weights: Seated Dumbbell Row (5x5), Chest Flies (3x8), Shoulder Exercises with Resistance Band (Front and Lateral Shoulder Raises — usually 3x8)

**Weekend Day (Either Sat or Sunday, the other day I rest)**:

Cycle: Long Ride (2h+)

Weights: REST

If I am able to on the weekend, I add one long stretching day in, usually by watching a guided yoga exercise on YouTube.

 I've been benching with dumbbells twice a week for the past couple of months as part of an upper body strength routine. Been feeling great.

But last week, I suddenly felt "off" when benching. My weight was still the same, I added 2 reps to each set. But I never felt "comfortable" during it. I didn't feel like I was going to drop the dumbbell or anything, I'm not sure how to explain it. The next 2 times I've benched, I still felt the same way (no weight/rep increase).

Has anyone had a similar experience?

 Hello everyone! 

I'm 26 year old male 172cm, and I'm afraid I took a really bad path to starting a healthier life. Long story short I'm eating around 900kcal a day and managed to loose 4 kilos in a month (started from 74). I realised maybe I reached the state "skinny fat". I read that resistance training can help with this problem, so I ordered some resistance bands to train with. So far I aimed to walk 10-20k steps every day, in the last week most of the time over 20k steps. 

Im really worried, how to transition from this 900kcal a day weight loss diet to a muscle building lifestyle. Can someone point me to the right direction where to look for answers or give me some tips, where to go from my situation?

Thank you for your help and time 🙏

 Long story short I sold my car recently.  Been working from home since March so there was no point in having a vehicle that never gets driven.  

Is it possible to temporarily turn my garage into a gym?  I do plan on buying a car around Oct when we're supposed to be back in the office (though that might get pushed back) so I can't do anything permanent and whatever I buy needs to be stuff that I can either sell quickly in Oct or easily store. I feel like things like a squat rack are out of the question.  I've seen some workout systems with bands that supposedly let you squat and dead lift but I don't know how good they are.

 I've written a **[free strength program generator](https://github.com/tommyod/streprogen)** in the programming language Python. It allows you to easily create a concrete plan for strength training.

- [Example PDF output](https://github.com/tommyod/streprogen/blob/master/examples/3DaySplitWithPeriodization.pdf)

It has many **features**, such as:

- The duration of the program is whatever you like (I like 8-12 weeks).
- Add as many days per week as you like (2 days, 3 days, 4 days, whatever).
- Add as many exercises as you wish. Split, full body, whatever.
- Set/rep schemes are autogenerated based on starting weight.
- Non-trivial periodization is possible.
- Uses mathematical optimization to chose optimal set/rep schemes.

To create a program, you **write code like this**:

    from streprogen import Program
    
    # Create a 4-week program, rounding every exercise to nearest unit og 5kg
    program = Program("My first program!", duration=8, units="kg", round_to=5)
    
    with program.Day("Day A"):
        program.DynamicExercise("Bench press", start_weight=80, min_reps=3, max_reps=8)

 I've written a **[free strength program generator](https://github.com/tommyod/streprogen)** in the programming language Python. It allows you to easily create a concrete plan for strength training.

- [Example PDF output](https://github.com/tommyod/streprogen/blob/master/examples/3DaySplitWithPeriodization.pdf)

It has many **features**, such as:

- The duration of the program is whatever you like (I like 8-12 weeks).
- Add as many days per week as you like (2 days, 3 days, 4 days, whatever).
- Add as many exercises as you wish. Split, full body, whatever.
- Set/rep schemes are autogenerated based on starting weight.
- Non-trivial periodization is possible.
- Uses mathematical optimization to chose optimal set/rep schemes.

To create a program, you **write code like this**:

    from streprogen import Program
    
    # Create a 4-week program, rounding every exercise to nearest unit og 5kg
    program = Program("My first program!", duration=8, units="kg", round_to=5)
    
    with program.Day("Day A"):
        program.DynamicExercise("Bench press", start_weight=80, min_reps=3, max_reps=8)
        program.DynamicExercise("Squats", start_weight=100, min_reps=3, max_reps=8)
        
    with program.Day("Day B"):
        program.DynamicExercise("Deadlifts", start_weight=100, min_reps=2, max_reps=7)
        program.StaticExercise("Curls", "3 x 10 @ 18kg")

    # Render the program, then print it
    program.render()
    print(program)

 Hi folks. Maybr the wrong place to ask, but i’m looking for a decent fitness/workout app for iOS. 

But... i dont want it to give or suggest, or even live track my workouts. I basically want to get to the end of a session, plug in what i’ve done and have it list my stats, track progress etc. 

I do a hell of a lot of cycling, a fair bit of running and recently started lifting weights with my bro. I guess i’m sort of looking for a fitness diary/journal of sorts... 

I’d prefer one with a free trial and would be happy buying if i like it later. Not interested in subscriptions. 

Does such a thing exist? 

Thanks.

 Just curious about a few compound lifts (for optimizing weekly volume for best recovery):

Bench:

* Doing tricep extensions targets triceps and doesn't work chest

* Doing chest flyes targets chest, and leaves your shoulders/triceps most untrained

* How does one deal with the classic bench press? Does each set count towards chest, tricep and front delt sets?

* How about close grip bench - heavy on the triceps, but also chest? Maybe 50% of the set counts towards chest?

Press:

* Predominantly delts, but also triceps and lats - do you count these as tricep/lat movements too?

Squats:

* Quads for days, but also lower back - do you count them as a lower back exercise too?


Deadlift:

* I feel like this one is pretty well balanced as trap, lower back and quads/hams (and counts for all four muscle groups)

 Can you get good biceps without isolation work? I run a push - pull - legs routine and noticed that on a pull day almost all my lifts are compounds, but for primarily my back, e.g pull-ups, rows, and lat pulldowns. So I'm wondering if I should do bicep curls or if I would just be wasting my time.

 Lifted weights on and off for the last 18 years. Usually cutting cuz I’d get chubby after a few years after stopping. 7 years ago I did starting strength for 6 months or so and it was nice to finally see my strength go up instead of just maintaining cuz cutting. Of course I gained more fat than wanted and life got in the way so I quit lifting again. 7 years later I’m back at it, finishing my cut in a few weeks, following an HLM routine got back a bit of my old strength but not all (B 210x5x5, S 2205x5 and DL 365 5x5) dropped from 240 to 175 with abs and 13-14% bf. Thinking about transitioning to a slow bulk and want to try Phraks GSLP. Just wondering if a LP would still work for me since I’m technically not a beginner.. but after so many years and coming out of 6 month cut I think I’d still qualify as a beginner and could get those gains decently fast still?

 I’m doing the beginner prescription from Barbell Medicine. Im doing an RPE based program because my strength varies wildly day to day depending on how rested i am.

How do i determine RPE if my perceived exertion is different for my cardio and my ability to lift? I’ll try to explain what i mean

I did my first day of beginner prescription and lifted 155lbsx8 @ RPE 8 for my last set for deadlifts. https://streamable.com/cq4bze

In terms of actually lifting the weight it was easy but i get so out of breath i start to get dizzy by the 6th rep and by the time i finish the set of 8, i felt i could only do maybe 2 more.

I did rest for 3 minutes in between sets

If i had perfect cardio i could do this for a lot more reps. So should i base RPE on how i feel with my cardio? I am working on my conditioning but its going to take a while.

I now see him in the gym multiple times a week now that it’s finally open and I’ve yet to acknowledge him or say hi and he hasn’t either to me. And we lift right next to each other a lot. I feel like I’m in this perpetual state of awkward because I want to say hi but I don’t know how to initiate this conversation at this point and I don’t know where it would go. And it would be even worse if he didn’t remember he talked to me seeing as it was like 0300 and he was probably half asleep from being woken up for a call. Anyway, he seems to only hits legs and has great quads. Maybe I should just lead with that at this point. Sigh.

We spent about 10 minutes helping him look for the lights, then he got a call to say the manager would be there in 2-3 minutes. I took out my phone torch, found the dumbbells I wanted, and started lifting in the dark. 
The lights came on mid-way through my first set, and there was a mild cheer from those of us in the gym.

 2 weeks back from the abyss (4 months off), and seeing progress. DOMS are much better. I’m lifting at maybe 75-80% of what I was at pre-lockdown. Not sure if that’s encouraging or just what I should’ve expected, but I’m taking it as a positive. Beer belly is gonna take time...

New gym reservation policy is a mixed bag. It’s actually nice to be able to go and know it won’t be packed. Otoh you’re locked into your time slot, so if something comes up you can’t just go later... or forget to reserve before slots fill up and you’re shit outta luck.

 When I got back after lockdown I began just doing 3x8 for the main lifts, just to get used to it again, and then move back to my program. Now I'm still doing 3x8, because for some reason I'm still making progress doing it. I mean, I'll take it, just unexpected, is all.


Also had a good bench workout. I had intended to see if I could maybe reach 8 reps. Instead, it went so well that I couldn't help but just do 9 reps, with at least two or three reps in the tank, so that was a really nice surprise.

I'm still an excessive squat-morninger, though, so there is still some balance in the universe

On one weirdly quiet morning, after I finish my deadlifts, I notice in the mirror what can only be described as the "epitome of Crossfit"  happening right behind me. One guy was doing speed cleans, one going super sonic on the exercise bike, the other throwing a medicine ball against the wall, and the last guy churning out burpees.

Here are some progress pics, one from the very beginning and two from this week:  
http://imgur.com/a/tddiZzC

I started lifting around the 10 of January (yes, new years resolution) and started out with two weird programs that my gym proposed to new members. I didn't make much gains in the beginning because I hadn't heard of linear progression. I also didn't know how to train properly, did silly things like compound exercises after multiple isolation exercises. I started eating more in April (currently at 3000kcal/day with 180g of protein). I used to be quite fat a year ago, around 98-100kg/216-220lbs.
I also started the PPL program that is recommended on this sub in April. My current lifts are:

(Never tried 1RM's, these are my best sets)


I was thinking about starting the 531 BBB programm when my linear progression stalls and at the same time bulk since I don't have that much mass.


What do you guys think?  

Too early to bulk?  

Is the 531 BBB too advanced after my first PPl?  

Any other critique/advice?  


No idea about my body fat %, it doesn't really bother me that much.

Here are some progress pics, one from the very beginning and two from this week:  
http://imgur.com/a/tddiZzC

I started lifting around the 10 of January (yes, new years resolution) and started out with two weird programs that my gym proposed to new members. I didn't make much gains in the beginning because I hadn't heard of linear progression. I also didn't know how to train properly, did silly things like compound exercises after multiple isolation exercises. I started eating more in April (currently at 3000kcal/day with 180g of protein). I used to be quite fat a year ago, around 98-100kg/216-220lbs.
I also started the PPL program that is recommended on this sub in April. My current lifts are:


Bench: 82.5kg/180lbs ×6  

OHP: 50kg/110lbs ×5  

Squat: 97.5kg/215lbs ×8  

DL: 130kg/286lbs ×8

30/F/5'6.5/122lbs. I'm lost for what to do for my fitness routine. Currently, I'm doing Gorgeous Glutes after liking a lot of Bret Contreras programs. I have shoulder issues so I don't do a ton of upper body other than the big lifts (3x8 bench, row, press). I walk an average 18,000 steps a day. I run and do incline walking several times a week. Mostly I just feel like I've put on too much fat during quarantine. I've been doing a caloric deficit down from 129 lbs.

I really miss the gym.

Mostly have trained in the 3-5 rep range (mostly 3). I think all the strength training without much hypertrophy work has left me a little skinny fat. 

I’m also 48 hours fasted, so I look a little depleted in the photo.

Cut or bulk and why? Thanks for the help!

I've lost about 20 lbs over the past 4 months.  I know I'm probably around 20% bf but I was wondering if it's worth it to keep eating at a deficit or if I should increase my calories now. 

Gyms are still closed in my state so I have to settle for my home bodyweight workouts or runs for now. I lifted at the gym all last year but im feeling much weaker as a combination of the deficit and gyms being closed.

 Diets gone to shit, losing cuts and gaining good strength and fat. Going for a barefoot beach run now, doubt it will cover the two pounds of lump crab and tartar sauce I just smashed but what the hell. Always been more into strength than aesthetics anyway. (Mostly because diet is hard and I need a solid excuse)

I’m 2 weeks into my 4 week cut and I’m down 4lbs.  I’m experimenting with just doing daily vinyasa yoga to see if I can maintain my strength while improving my flexibility and stability.

I run ~40 miles per week, weight lift 2-3x per week, maintenance or slight deficit on calories, and keep my protein high.  

BF% estimate?

 Can anyone rate my routine? I've recently started taking the gym seriously again after almost 5 years. **I have lagging shoulders and legs** due to bad past habits such as always benching first on push day, only doing DB shoulder press never OHP, and if I ended up skipping a day of PPL it would be leg day. Trying to make up for those body parts now. I run a PPL split, no rest days.

Legs:

* Squats 5x5
* Romanian deadlifts 4x8-12
* Leg press 4x12-15
* Calf raise 4x12-15
* Hamstring curl 4x10-12
* Calf raise 4x12-15

Pull:

* Deadlifts 5x5
* Squats 4x8-10
* Pullups 5xAMRAP (only getting about 5-8 right now with bodyweight)
* Seated cable row 4x10-12
* Face pulls 4x12-15
* DB curls 4x8-12
* Dropset concentration hammer curls (both arms at once, SUPER good pump) 4x(~12 + ~12)
* Shrugs 4x12-15

Push:

* OHP 5x5
* Bench 4x8-12
* DB incline 4x8-12
* DB shoulder 4x8-12
* Side raise 4x12-15
* Dips 4x12-15
* Tricep rope pushdown 4x12-15

<td>Comment contains deadlifting: 
 Is it unsafe or suboptimal to do a push/pull split with no separate leg day 6x per week? I'd do quads on push day and hamstrings on pull day, but not work either too hard and focus on upper body. I wouldn't be deadlifting. Each muscle group would be worked pretty hard every 48 hours.

Basically turning a 6 day PPL routine into a 6 day A/B routine? I don't want to neglect legs, but I really want to hit upper body much more than lower body for my current goals.

Also I'm not advanced, but probably between beginner and intermediate.
