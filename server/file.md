 Definitely agree to what was said! My sister was having the same problem. She does the job well! But her MUM says she’s too serious. Doesn’t smile. You don’t always have to be smiling but I was always told, if you want the part you gotta play the part. If your RDO or ACO is in you be a little more extra than usual smile a little more. One little technique I do is crack little jokes here and there with my team so I’m constantly smiling! Lol after months she passed her harvest program and is up for a kitchen test after that promotion to shift leader. You got this! Just remember like one of my girls used to say, lights, camera, action! Lol

 I concur.  The LED DRLs on the 8.5 are one of the best DRL designs Audi ever produced.  I love the way they wrap around the whole light creating the "squinting eye" effect. [I am also biased.](https://imgur.com/a/0Pvgg0G)

 Congrats! She's a beauty.



Side note - I know where you got it! =) 
Grew up next to Nashua, and as a kid, driving by the 2 Audi and Porsche dealers there I'd always tell myself one day I'd go back and get either one of those cars from either one of those dealerships. Still a dream in progress for me, but enjoy tearing up those streets!

Been dieting and lifting for the last year and a half, happy with the progress so far but my concern isn't really losing weight at this point, it's putting on muscle. Was wondering if anyone had any tips or critiques of perhaps body parts that seem lagging or just anything else they have noticed. Been doing 3 month rotations of NSuns and PPL both 6 times a week. Also eat 1850 calories a day with greater than 150 grams of protein and ~50 grams of fat. Whatever is left over is filled with carbs. If I had to guess I have another 20 lbs to lose

 [29M/6'3"/185lbs](http://imgur.com/a/cMq6UuF)

9 months between the left and right - on the left I was 235, on the right 185. Just looking for a little feedback on my physique progress and what I should maybe work on next. Lower body isn't pictured because I already know it needs to grow, although I feel like my squat and deadlift are bigger than you'd expect by looking at these chicken legs.

I was always extremely skinny as a teenager (about 165-170lbs at 6'3") and never did a minute of exercise outside of some outdoor sports occasionally - didn't start lifting until about 24. Bulked up and gained a lot of strength in the first phase of the journey, but it was mostly just fucking around and moving weight without any real programming, so I didn't make as much strength progress as I should have. I eventually got up to the 235 you see on the left and realized I was gaining more fat than muscle, so I went on the first cut of my life for 9 months and lost 50 lbs. I lost quite a bit of strength at first, but am now just about back at the numbers I was doing at my heaviest (I currently weigh 195). These are my best estimates for my 1RMs in lbs -

Bench: 220
Squat: 330
Deadlift: 430
OHP: 135

 [35M, 309 lbs, 6'0"](http://imgur.com/a/QvQQ0Xu)

This is a month of progress for me since starting resistance bands/ cardio at home working out almost daily, along with starting calorie counting 2 weeks ago (currently on 2800 calories). 

My biggest problem is currently 2 things

1) my right arm struggles with the same resistance as my left, which makes me feel like im not getting the full workout on it. Part way through the sets my right arm will give out and i cant finish the workout on it. I was curious if i need to dial back the resistance on my bands, making my left arm not get as good a workout so my right arm will catch up, or deal with the resistance on my right arm even if i dont get the full set in on it [(eg, this happens on my 3rd set of standing chest presses)](http://imgur.com/a/rrgFfhV)

2) currently I do kneeling push ups. I cant keep my core steady enough to be able to do normal push ups all the way down. Ive encorporated crunches and scissor kicks to try and strengthen my core. Was wondering if there is anything else I can do, or if doing push ups is just something that will take time for me to get to.

Have been an athlete my whole life, but got into weight lifting 3 months ago. Just now starting to get the hang of it. I'm seeing a lot of guys around my height weighing a lot less and looking like they got 15lb on me. Guessing bodyfat is around 11%,but could be wrong. Some if my friends say its because my legs are bigger,but I honestly think they're average.

 [18M, 190cm (6'2), 76kg (167lbs)](https://imgur.com/a/LF1XPnP)

I've always been a skinny kid and I'm bulking now, but I wonder if I should continue, because my body fat level has probably never been so high and I'm gaining mostly abdominal fat and my face is becoming more and more puffy. My clothes feel tighter and my family noticed that I'm becoming more puffy. I probably hold a lot of water. Every morning when I wake up I have many [indentaions](https://imgur.com/a/67csTyM) in the skin. I've been doing calisthenics workout 5/6 times a week for almost three years. In July, I started barbell training. Firstly, I was following Stronglifts, but I had really poor results and I switched to Greyskull LP. The reason I'm gaining mostly abdominal fat is probably that I'm not getting stronger and I'm not able to progressively overload my workouts. I thought maybe I wasn't eating enough so I've increased my calories and it seems I only gained fat, because my strength hasn't increased almost whatsoever. I don't know what else I should do. I count calories and steps, I work out consistently, I have never drunk or smoked in my life, I do not drink sugary drinks, I prepare all my meals and sleep at least 8h per night (often even up to 10h). Most people don't even do all these things and they still have way better progress than me. Does anyone have any advices?

 You’re a new player? This comment you posted said otherwise. Thanks to u/aom1neDa1ki- for finding this.

Hey, I am a clinkz spammer with about 600 games in total (with old clinkz + new burning army clinkz) Let me tell you the essence of clinkz :

Learn to play around his strafe timing - once it goes on cooldown, he is useless for the next 16 seconds

Let me tell you how to counter him with heroes:

1.	⁠Pick supports with disable / saves:

•	⁠Lion (hex + earthspike) ,
•	⁠Shaman (hex + shackle),
•	⁠Lich (sinister gaze),
•	⁠Oracle (disarm + dispell)
•	⁠Shadow demon (disruption + dispell)

Let me tell you how to counter him with items:

1.	⁠Supports : Buy ghost scepter (self-save) /haven halberd (for disarm)/ euls (for dispelling strafe)
2.	⁠Tanky Heroes : Buy blade mail
3.	⁠Strafe removal : He is completely reliant to having strafe to kill enemy, try to bait out these spells.

Before you cry, ghost scepter is a very cheap item (even for supports). You can buy it before the 15 min mark too.

Remeber clinkz is very fragile hero, once you disengage in team fights he has to wait for strafe to come back online (16 sec) at max level.

Clinkz is kind of like riki, he takes advantage of :

1.	⁠Un-Coordinated teams - aka farming alone without vision
2.	⁠Those who dont want to build the right items

Regarding clinkz ultimate, I think what we have now (7.27C) is perfect without any change.

I did the deadlift day, so I only did deadlifts, but then I didn't fancy any of the accessories from the 5/3/1 app so I did pull-ups. But I think that was too much after the deads.

Will my size gains suffer if I don't do any accessories?

It will be 4 days a week. I generally prefer full body to upper/lower because I feel like I can get more volume in that way. However that leads me to the problem that 1 lift will always not have a rest day before. For me, I feel like the best option would be doing T1 Squat/T2 Bench after a T1 OHP/T2 Deadlift day. My Squat (180kg) and Bench (130kg) are currently stronger than my OHP (70kg), and I haven't been Deadlifting in a while and need to do some catchup there.

Upper/Lower would obviously allow me to just do legs a day after upper body without neglecting any lift, but doing lunges after squat and deadlift is just horrible

Just curious how other people would deal with that situation?

 Programming question:

I wanna create a routine following the philosophy and method outlined in the "General Gainz" post by GZCL ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy\_gday\_gainerz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/)).

It will be 4 days a week. I generally prefer full body to upper/lower because I feel like I can get more volume in that way. However that leads me to the problem that 1 lift will always not have a rest day before. For me, I feel like the best option would be doing T1 Squat/T2 Bench after a T1 OHP/T2 Deadlift day. My Squat (180kg) and Bench (130kg) are currently stronger than my OHP (70kg), and I haven't been Deadlifting in a while and need to do some catchup there.

Upper/Lower would obviously allow me to just do legs a day after upper body without neglecting any lift, but doing lunges after squat and deadlift is just horrible

Just curious how other people would deal with that situation?

Is this okay for strength training or should I just go heavy (110kg+) and forget about the first few sets

 So I started bench pressing 2 weeks ago (learned the form in high school) and I started at 25 lbs (95 total) which was too easy, then went to 40 lbs (125 total) which was still too easy, and now I’m doing 42.5 lbs (130 lbs total). This is for 5x5. My friend told me that I should stay at lighter weight to strengthen my supporting muscles as I’m new to weight lifting again. Is he right? He says I need to focus more on form cause my form can get worse with higher weight but less weight feels too easy so I’m not sure. I don’t really struggle to complete 5x5

 **How/what and when to eat when you train at night?**

Because of my work scheduke and lifestyle, I started to train around 6-7 pm my hour. After training, i feel like puking so i can’t eat instantly

However at 9-10 pm i’m super damn hungry and if i eat, i’ll feel bloated as fuck. 

I mostly eat protein (I’m on a keto diet). 

I need to lose weight so I train with this purpose

I do 30-40 min/day

20min intense cardio (very intense)
20 min weightlifting - low weights (because of my medical restrictions i can’t carry too much). 

I’m a girl. Not fit. Not much previous experience

I try to understand how to eat and how to train. 
I can’t eat before training because I will puke. 
I can’t eat right after training for the same reason. 

Then 1-2 hrs later i’m starving and I eat a keto meal (meat with basic salad). But eating very late makes me very bloated. 

I drink a lot of water every day. I just feel i have no found my balance yet. Maybe you can give me some ideas. Thanks.

Other info:
I eat 1500 cals a day. Sometimes 1200-1300. 
I’m 5’7
Around 220 lbs now.

I did get more fit after 1 week of daily training but i gained weight, not lost. And i sweat so much every day and my died is tracked and on point. I know it’s water weight but... it’s been more than a week now..

 What am I am "training" so to speak if I routinely do farmer's walks but my 'progression' involves using the same weight every time and only increasing the distance/sets of walks I do?

 So I’ve been lifting for a few months now, eating at maintenance to lost fat and gain muscle. Aside from my goal of gaining muscles, my thighs and waist are getting bigger (jeans are a bit tighter), I’m enjoying my PHUL program but I’d like to lose volume in my lower body, is it just a beginners thing that the increase compared to the time I’ve been lifting is unrealistic or would i keep increasing size (till reaching a plateau ofc) if i stick to the same plan? Or should i just substitute my lower hypertrophy with a full day split to minimize lower hypertrophy

 Both.

Hiking fitness isn't like other types of fitness. 

When you get better at lifting, you can lift heavier things. But it's still the same *kind* of thing.

When you get better at running, you can run faster or farther but you still run the same *kind* of places.

When you get better at hiking it unlocks adventures you previously could not have had.

Last year I hiked with a friend every weekend and we went on progressively longer, steeper, and higher elevation hikes. At the very end of summer, we did a 3 day backpacking trip to the highest peak in Utah (13k feet +).

That particular location on earth wasn't accessible to us before we did all that hiking.

<td>Comment contains powerlifting: 
 Firstly, you're at a really good spot. 10-12 miles in a day is pretty solid, especially if you include elevation and a loaded ruck. I'm an avid hiker and do regular powerlifting as well, just to give you an idea of my perspective.

My suggestion, start looking into multi-day hikes or hikes that have lots of elevation. You may have to pick-up some new gear for multi-day, but there's always good deals if you look and you can buy used  as well. But I've found that that either of these two kinds of hikes were a game changer for me, in terms of being fit for hiking.

<td>Comment contains strength: 
 In training with weights progressive overload till after years you reach your genetic ceiling for how much muscle and strength you can have. The same thing should apply to such cardio conditioning as hiking which I think is safer than running for not causing you to digest some muscles to get the energy. Adding weight training might improve your hiking and it is possible to enjoy it once you get used to it.

<tr>
<td>Comment contains powerlifter/strongman: 
 I'm a powerlifter/strongman, so it isn't the same. But if I apply my principles here, then yes. If your goal is improving, then once you adapt to any stimuli you should push it a lil bit more. Progressive overload. This is if you desire stronger legs, better conditioning and improved fitness. If this is just something you enjoy doing and you do it to stay in decent, reasonable shape, then just stay consistent and you will still reap benefits of regular exercise.

For any exercise, to improve, progressive overload is key:)

Want to do muscle ups, cant even do a regular muscle up with proper form.  I wanna ask you guys what are the strength requirements for a static muscle up (my goal). I have good triceps but quite weak biceps as I dont engage them much and then get tired easily (8 pull ups). I used to be able to do more but gotten weaker. Now I wanna build forearms, biceps and shoulders for the transitional phase in a muscle up. What exercises should I do and till when i.e when do I determine I am progressing strength wise to be able to do a static muscle.

 Hello,  


I'd like to know if anyone follows a similar routine and/or have any tips related to it. I just started cardio every morning and I combine it with light lifting, about half the weight or maybe less than I do on normal work out session. The light lifting is only for muscle groups that I will workout the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

An example:  


Monday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Pull), Evening: Push Day

Tuesday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Legs), Evening: Pull Day

Wednesday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Push), Evening: Legs Day

Thursday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Pull), Evening: Push Day

Friday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Legs), Evening: Pull Day

Saturday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Push), Evening:  Legs Day

Sunday - Rest Day  


Any tip on this routine? Does anyone have followed a similar approach for the long term?  
I'd like also to add a Full Body workout but I guess I have to change the total days of my program, from 7 to 8 or 9 (I don't mind working out on Sundays!).

I'd like also to add a Full Body workout but I guess I have to change the total days of my program, from 7 to 8 or 9 (I don't mind working out on Sundays!).

 Hello,  


I'd like to know if anyone follows a similar routine and/or have any tips related to it. I just started cardio every morning and I combine it with light lifting, about half the weight or maybe less than I do on normal work out session. The light lifting is only for muscle groups that I will workout the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

An example:  


Monday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Pull), Evening: Push Day

Tuesday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Legs), Evening: Pull Day

Wednesday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Push), Evening: Legs Day

Thursday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Pull), Evening: Push Day

Friday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Legs), Evening: Pull Day

Saturday - Morning: Cardio, Light lifting (Push), Evening:  Legs Day

Sunday - Rest Day  


Any tip on this routine? Does anyone have followed a similar approach for the long term?  
I'd like also to add a Full Body workout but I guess I have to change the total days of my program, from 7 to 8 or 9 (I don't mind working out on Sundays!).

 Suggested Edits to this Leg Workout

My current leg day workout is as follows:

Back Squat: 5x8

RDL: 3x8

Dumbell Lunge: 4x20(10 each leg)

Dumbell Hamstring Curl: 3x10

&amp;#x200B;

I do conventional deadlifts on my pull day. Currently, I am working out from home and only have a squat rack, plates and dumbells, no machines or cables. I plan on using progressive overload with this. I am looking to grow my legs, and if you have any suggested edits that would be greatly appreciated.

 I take one big breath before un-racking it, walk it out, then lift as many reps as I can without exhaling. Usually I get 4 or 5 then I have to pause at the top and take another breath. You should literally be taking one tiny step backwards after un-racking so there's no need to take a second breath.

 I do small breaths while trying to stay as tight as possible. It's not sustainable but it'll get me to like 8 heavy reps without losing too much strength. Staying tight is actually the biggest thing for me, to the point where I don't even press from an unrack, I actually clean the weight up for every set

 A lot of these comments are very misleading and far too negative. Brisk walking is in fact considered low intensity cardio and is a good place to start. Calculate your personal max heart rate, try to walk at a pace that targets 60% to 80% of that for about 45 minutes to an hour and you’ll be far better off than if you did nothing or if you had tried to throw yourself into something more intense like running or swimming like some of the other comments are suggesting. Over time increase your pace and as your endurance improves (and your strength increases assuming you’re also working out) you can integrate higher intensity cardio workouts.

The reality is that getting mobile and making the act of exercising a regular part of your routine is where you should start, not some marathon training regiment.

 Exercise Scientist here. 

The problem is, if you’ve been doing the 15k steps for a while, and you’re still maintaining your weight or gaining, then that means you are consuming too many calories.

The 15K steps is great for your health, but it’s not going to help you lose weight unless you cut back on calories. 

I would suggest a full body resistance training program at least twice a week, some form of steady-state cardio (walking, running, biking, swimming, etc) at least 3-5 days a week for 30-60 minutes, and a calorie restriction (no less than 1200 per day for a woman, or 1500 for a man).

You can use a [TDEE Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net) to get a rough estimate on what you can eat in a day. Be extremely honest with your exercise level. Currently, you are getting “light” exercise if all you do is the 15K steps. If you add in the 2 days of lifting and 3-5 days of cardio, then you would be moderate. 

This will give you your maintenance calories. Subtract 100-300 if you want to lose weight slowly, or 500-1000 if you want to lose weight quickly. If you don’t work out for a week, or if you skip days, then adjust accordingly. Be brutally honest with yourself. And, most importantly, be consistent. 

Good luck, and let me know if you need any help.

 Does it burn calories? Yes.

Does it have the same benefits for your heart and visceral fat? Probably not.

If your heart is healthy and you don't have too much visceral fat: You are probably good to go.

If you have visceral fat or if you want your heart muscles to be stronger: do higher intensity workout (lifting or HIIT or something).

There are more studies like this one if you poke around.

Imo you should be aiming for zone 3 hr, or at least high zone 2, to actually be considered meaningful cardio.

 15k steps is better than 0 steps, but no this wouldn't be cardio. Cardio requires elevation of heart rate and is meant in a small way to also strengthen the heart. If you went on lets say a hike that elevated your heart rate then that would be light cardio, but spread throughout an entire workday no.

<tr>
<td>Comment contains lift: 
 Yes, it does, there has been a lot of false info put out there about losing weight and general fitness. You will lose weight no matter what if you're in a caloric deficit, exercising is just supplemental and allows you to reach your deficit easier. People run, bike, and perform HIIT for cardio often times because its a quicker way to burn calories but walking will do just fine and is less impact on your joints. The main thing is adding in weight training during your cut, I personally lift 5-6 days and week and walk about 10k steps a day, with my diet, I lose about 1lb  a week. The more muscle you have, the faster you burn calories and the less fat you store

 I lost 65lbs recently and am still losing, aiming for 15lbs more. I was almost the exact same weight as you 5 months ago (a bit more) with a similar daily step count. The amount you are walking is a great base to build a diet and lifestyle that leads to weight loss, but it's nothing without your diet being adjusted and some more exercise. It's a very low intensity cardio workout but I wouldn't add it to the fitness app you are using, just write in your personal specs that you are an active person. I'm just gonna quickly tell you what worked for me and hope it gives you some guidance:

* If you live within 15 miles of your work, cycle to work. Integrate exercise into your life. Use a bike to get around, walk instead of drive. Up that step count where you can. 2k more steps a day is another 14k a week, and 56k a month. After an initial struggle you will begin to enjoy exercise and the natural highs it brings with it.
* On that topic, get interested in a form of exercise you enjoy. For me, medium to long distance cycling (30 miles plus), soccer, and swimming became my principal interests. Running sports and running in general might have to come later as you don't want to put too much pressure on the legs. I found that once I was about 30lbs down I felt much lighter and more capable of running around. At first, low impact like swimming and cycling will allow you to get those hours of exercise a week in, not only to lose weight but feel way fitter and more physically capable.
* Stop drinking beer and wine, and any sugary drinks you are consuming. If you drink, drink a white liquor such as gin or vodka, with a calorie free mixer. This will still impede your progress but it's okay on the weekend.
* Track your calories very strictly at first. Download a calorie counter like myfitnesspal or fatsecret. Use a scale. Cook your meals if you can. Re-educate yourself about what you are eating and how many calories it contains. Find out about its nutritional content. This is the most important thing. Use something that tracks macros - carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Get your carbohydrates through vegetables like carrots, legumes, corn, beets, and fruits. Stop eating rice, grains, bread, and pasta on weekdays. Consume them in moderation at the weekend for your relaxation days/cheat meals/whatever you wanna call them. Remember you are re-educating yourself about food in general and trying to build towards a more sustainable future weight.
* After 2 months I stopped doing this as I had developed a good understanding of what to avoid and had a way better understanding of portion size. I know you didn't ask about food but it really is the most important aspect of all this - what you are putting in your mouth. You could do 2 hours of exercise a day but if you are eating and drinking badly it will have a very low impact.

My weight loss has been dramatic because I put in the time and effort to re-educating myself about food and getting interested in exercise, and integrating it into my life. Anyone can do it if they try. It's worth it, and good luck!

 As others have said more correctly then I am about to.  While it doesn't count as cardio it can be a powerful part of helping you get in shape depending on your diet and lifestyle.  By definition cardio exercises are meant to train your cardiovascular system.  Basically unless you are increasing/stressing your heart rate, it isn't cardio.

 Walking and low intensity cycling is the only cardio that I do, I’ll also only hit about 10k steps a day with about 40ish mins on the bike. I hate running and HIIT so much. I’m not sure why but I can force myself to do stuff that I hate in every category except for cardio. My endurance for running is consequently horrible and I’m out of breath insanely fast. I think I’d only be bothered to change if my lifting endurance was greatly affected. I need to do better though.

 Hello, I've been working out again for 2 months doing a PPL split 6 times a week. Yesterday I've did a musclemass, body fat calculation with a scale. The results were too good to be true and I just wanted some opinions on it. 

I went from 73kg to 79kg

Muscle mass 35.4kg to 40.2kg

Bodyfat 10.0kg to 8.9kg. 

My PR's(1 rep PRs):

Benchpress: 75kg
Deadlift: 130kg
Squat: 90kg


Like the numbers tell me im doing good but if i look in the mirror i have decent shoulders/arms/chest but i still look skinnyfat and have love handles.

Like, my results say i have around 11.6% BF which i really doubt.

 My split vs upper/lower

I have had a pretty average routine (don't know the name) where I did the following...
Monday: Legs (3 exercises), Shoulders (3 exercises)

Tuesday: Chest (3 exercises), Triceps (3 exercises)

Wednesday: Back (3 exercises), Biceps (3 exercises)

Thursday: Legs (3 exercises), Shoulders (3 exercises)

Friday: Chest (3 exercises), Triceps (3 exercises)

Saturday: Back (3 exercises), Biceps (3 exercises)

Sunday: Rest

One compound on each day such as Squats for legs day, Deadlifts for back day and Bench Press (mostly incline) for chest day. I start with Legs + Shoulders because I like doing shoulders before chest for some reason I feel like I'm much stronger if my shoulders are pumped
This worked very well, saw some really good gains but over time lost motivation and I felt like I spent too many days on the gym I was busy and skipped few days or even weeks at a time.
So I decided to switch to a Upper/Lower split for the past 2 months and I guess it's early to tell but it feels horrible for upper body. I feel like I do way too little exercises on each muscle, don't really get any pump or strength gain. It is amazing for my legs though I've seen some good results! But for upper body it's almost like a joke. It's not that I'm tired at the end of the exercise but doing your entire upper body takes shitload of time and I don't want to switch to PPL because that would be a 6 day routine which then I might as well go back to my old one
I should also mention I always do 4x8-12 on each exercise.
How can I solve this? Switch to heavier weights and do 5x5? Skip all the isolating movements and ONLY do compounds like Deadlift + Bench Press + Overhead Shoulder Press on upper day? Or is this routine just not for me and I should switch back to 6 day? Or do you recommend any other routines?

Required info: 23, M, 1 rep max: Bench(195), Squat(275), Dead(265), OHP(Never maxed but using 105 for the percentage based program), Main goal is to get those higher.

Monday: Bench, OHP, Curls

Tuesday: Squat, Sumo Dead, Lat Pulldown

Wednesday: OHP, Incline Bench, Soulder Flys (I think that's what they're called)

Thursday: Deadlift, Front Squat, Back extentions (Any tip on how I could replace this one would be nice because I don't have the equipment for it)

Friday: Bench, CGBP, Rows

So basically that's what I'm doing now and it's been very helpful at improving all of my big 3 but I would like to add another day on Saturdays that I can do strictly auxiliary lifts sorta like body building type things because I'm pretty sure what I do now is strictly strength and power lifting oriented.

 I've been training for 10+ years and I've always had good leg strength, but relatively small legs (quads in particular)

3 years ago I added bulgarian split squats and my quads blew up in size.

The only problem is that 1 set takes ages as I have to have a break between legs when I go heavy.

<td>Comment contains lifting: 
 I believe squats are the ultimate mass builder, but there are plenty of exercises that can build massive quads as well. Even if you have a V-squat machine that would be a good change up from the barbell. Hack squat, or even a pendulum squat if you're lucky enough to have one, are probably the best to build mass and for the quad sweep. As long as you get deep and full ROM, they're killer. 

Heavy walking lunges work well for me. But I also do Bulgarian split squats, front squats, leg extension superset goblet squats, and I'm really liking the belt squat lately. I like sissy squats too, though I'll usually do those as a finisher to burn them out or with a superset just to make shit harder, lol. 

If you're feeling like you can't recover from squats, maybe try lifting lighter and in different rep ranges, or try tempo squats or pause squats to change things up a bit.

 I usually just bench flat, unless its a max effort. Even then, my arch is pretty shitty and I mainly just do it to get a bit tighter.

Legally speaking, head (depending on federation), shoulders, and buttocks must touch the bench at all times during the lift. Feet must be planted on the floor. USAPL requires flat feet while USPA allows your heels to come off the ground.

 One of the best ways I’ve found to bench press is to form a “bridge or spring” effect. Arch your back enough to where you’re resting on your upper back, while pushing off the ground with your toes(this part can be tricky because depending on leg length, you may have to have your legs somewhat curled while planting toes on ground... others simply have their toes right in front of them planted due to short legs) The inertia/force pushing from your toes to the ground is going away from you, while your upper back is pushing force downward to the ground/bench. Lastly, you performing the bench press, this force is going upwards, away from you. These keys forces in key directions gives you very stable grounds In which to perform the exercise. Lastly, now you’re efficiently using your strength to your advantage... not using pure brute strength to lift the bar from your chest.

It amazes me how some can perform great lifts without using what I just described. Most people just lay flat, and have their feet just loosely sit in front of them without generating in opposite force. Astounding.

When trying to research it myself I’ve found all kinds of websites that talk about conditioning but they all say to do different things like running 3-5 miles, sprints, burpees, HIIT circuits, prowler, and a lot of the workouts that just seem like stuff in a normal strength or cardio workout which left me sort of confused, so can anyone help clarify what condition is and what it does?

 Been taking online quizzes to figure out as 'very active", but l'd love your opinion!

So here is a list of the exercise I do in a given week:

- Lifting 3x/wk. I'm new, so it's still light by most lifter's standards, but I'm progressing and lifting as heavy as I can. A typical workout consists of 3 big lifts and 3-4 accessory lifts, with varying set/rep ranges. Overall, a typical workout takes 70-90 minutes, including warmup and cool down.

- Aerobics/HIIT/Circuit Training 3-4x/wk. It varies, but I'm moving more into HIIT and circuit training, and away from steady-state and lower-intensity aerobics. A typical session is 30-60 mins, including warmup and cool down.

- Yoga 5-7 days a week. 15-30 min. I'm not very good, but I try my best😁

- Walking/hiking/cycling 5-7x/wk. Most of the time this is with my kids, and it's low-intensity enough that it doesn't really feel like exercise to me. But every day the weather permits, we at least go for a stroll. Typically I will walk, hike, or bike at least a mile every day it doesn't rain.

So...surely all of that qualifies as "very active", right? I mean, I could imagine being more active, especially since nothing I do lasts more than an hour and a half. But I do some kind of something pretty much 7 days a week. Wednesdays are usually my lightest days, but I do clean my whole house every Wednesday, so it's not like I'm sedentary. And Lord knows I never sit down with two young kids. So "very active" is an honest answer, right?

 Maybe I'm too late to get any response but hey, worth the shot!


So I'm trying to workout in my home. I only have one 25 lb dumbbell so I looked for a full body routine and found this one:


 https://youtu.be/RNOXsANA8MM



I tried it and only managed to complete half of it (10 minutes, not the 2 sets). I was wondering if it's ok? Maybe it's a stupid question but I want to know if I'll eventually improve so I can finish it or maybe I'm lifting too much weight or should I do another workout altogether? I'm planning to do it 3 times a week, I just want to be sure I'm not wasting my time lol.


A little bit of info about me if it helps:


I'm a 26 yo male, 177 cm height, 77 kg weight. I'm doing keto and my goal is to be fit, lose my beer belly  (I'm not fat, but I don't have a flat stomach) and build some muscle and strenght (I don't want a Mr. Olympia level body, just fit and sexy haha). I used to go to the gym and saw really good and fast results, but my life hit a brick wall and I got really depressed. During that time I indulged in very unhealthy habits (junk food, alcohol, drugs) but I'm good now and I want to improve myself a little so any help it's very much appreciated :)

Tl;dr: Is the workout in the video a good starting point for someone who can only complete half of it?

 Romanian dead lifts are good for glutes as it is a hip hinge thrust exercise. Kettlebell swings done right also target hit your butt as well as they involve hip hinging. Extra weapons in the arsenal to target the area if you choose.

In regards to what is better, isometric holds only build strength in quite a specific limited range of motion. Ideally you should work the muscle throughout its entire range of motion, which would make doing reps the better choice.

 If you want maximal glute gains, you should absolutely do both of em, doesn't have to be in the same workout though. I have 2-3 leg days and do hip thrusts one day and glute bridges in another. Bret Contreras aka the "Glute Guy" highly recommends doing both static and regular hip thrusts mixed with glute bridges and banded variants of the exercises. That way you build strength to do all of these exercises much heavier = gains.

 Looks like im down to about 152\~ now after a few months (been at a deficit for a few months but ive been trying to build up muscle at the same time). Starting to see my abs again and my arms and chest are visually thicker to me which is just nice to see. Im not losing weight as fast as i planned but thats fine, im clearly gaining muscle because all of my lifts have gone up/been significantly better from when i started a few months back.

Also my left side is starting to even out a bit more, i was able to pump out 10x3 with three second pauses the other day on my bench which was awesome. Normally since my left is weaker my right comes in and tries to take on a bit more of the weight so i normally give out on my right arm, not this time! 

My shoulder workouts seem to be helping my bad right one and it isnt grinding much anymore which is also awesome. Doing 10x3 on internal and external rotator cuff exercises with cables and a few other shoulder exercises, it looks to be really helping.

 Just finished week 4 of [Juggernaut's take on Deep Water](https://www.jtsstrength.com/deep-water-squat-training/) on Friday. I did 100 squats in four sets of 30, 25, 25, and 20 at 65% of my 1rm. I've never done anywhere near that kind of volume before. It was brutal, but I feel pretty good about it.

 Started March 2019 with fairly consistent gym going, no cardio but I walk everywhere on campus and I'm a cheap ass bastard so I park like half a mile away. 136 lbs (5'8") and your regular skinny boi body.

Ate lots of calories and gained a bit of muscle, but a bit more of bodyfat. March 2020 and I'm 147 lbs and it's quarantine time (still 5'8" tho). Dropped calories to about 2200 per day and did squats, pushups, and bicep curls at home with some DIY weights. Mostly maintained but started to gain weight and it was definitely not muscle. Maxxed out at 148-149 lbs and a 33" waist size. 

Started cutting about 500 calories a day and started the r/bodyweight RR, plus increased my steps a bunch to exceed my estimated steps from when I was still on campus, as well as HIIT on off days focusing my core. At first I wasn't dropping weight much at all, bouncing between 147-148lbs but my waist size kept dropping so I figured that was a good sign. About 3 months in and I'm in the 145's (reached there like two weeks ago, went slightly back up but back in it now) and I can finally see a 1 pack ab again! (My scoliosis tries real hard to hide it) Current waist size is about 29.5" which is cool I guess. Still hard to fit into shorts but now it's my thighs and ass that gets squeezed so I guess my squats are working pretty well. 

Biggest up is that my bodyweight strength is increasing rapidly. I switched to first two sets are 1 or 2 reps away from failure and final set is to failure which helped a ton and each day I work out I can reach the previous days failure. My plan is to keep cutting to as close to 140lbs as I can get. Hopefully by then I'll feel more comfortable to go back to the gym and start a bit of a bulk!

 Started my lean bulk. Week 1 was great. 

Half of current week, lifts are going up, even lagging ohp. Rest of the current week, I'm feeling sick, got a mild fever and already resting for 3 days and body temperature ain't normal still.

I'm unable to do anything other than wait it out, but calorie surplus feels so wrong, not to mention I don't even know what my tdee would be in couch potato mode.

 Recently started to correct all my form in every exercise, seeing great results and I'm cutting, I have lost 3kg so far from 87kg and I've gained some strength. Added my new favourite exercise to my shoulder routine which is the overhead press. Today was shoulder day and I managed to get 3-5 reps with 50kg or 110 pounds.

So I've had a couple of small victories :) and I've noticed my grip strength increase since I got a griper to help rehabilitate my arms because of Bicep-Tendonitis, everything slowly falling into place.

Hi  guys, I (17M 70kg 175cm) was just wondering if anyone could give me any advice regarding  my routine. In my country, the gyms have opened and I have been going  for about a month. I'm currently following an Upper/Lower split right  now, for two days a week, as I'm currently preparing for my end year  exams too. Once exams are done, I plan to continue the routine but up it  to four days a week. Here's my routine

Upper:

Bench Press 3x8 65kg

Incline bench 3x8 50kg

Cable Flies 3x10

Overhead press 3x8 30kg (seems criminally low here, any advice on how to improve this would be greatly appreciated)

Upright rows 3x8 30kg

Pull-ups 3x10 (used to be able to do weighted 10kg before quarantine hit, trying to work that back right now)

Tricep Pushdown 3x10

Bicep Curls 3x10

Lower:

Squats 3x8 85kg (adding 2.5kg to this every time I do this)

Deadlifts 3x5 105kg (also seems to be stalling)

Angled leg press 100kg

Leg Extensions

Leg Curls

Seated Cable rows

I'm  trying to hit every single muscle group within these two workouts, with  one or two assistance exercises for every compound exercise. On my rest  days, I may be able to do a routine of pushups and ab work. I'm just  curious if anyone can see any gaps or problems with my workout routine  that can be fixed? Trying to gain strength and if possible a bit of  weight. Thanks in advance!

 Cutting and strength loss question:

Does losing weight at a rate of 1-1.5 kgs(2-3 lbs) per week also cause stalling even if I'm a beginner lifter?

My chinups progress has stalled at 5 sets of 2 each. My OHP has also stalled at 51 kgs (112 lbs0 and bench at 70 kgs (154 lbs).

I thought at least my chinup progress would keep going up. Is this normal?

I'm 6'1 and currently weigh around 82 kgs (180 lbs). Still skinny fat so cutting, with barebones Greyskull LP.

3-4 @ 8.5 RPE

2-3 @ 9-9.5 RPE

3-4 @ 8.5 RPE

i don't really know if i'm explaining it right/if there is a program with this structure already (i'm sure it exists, i just don't know) but I guess i just want to know if anyone has done anything similar and seen good results.

 Trying to switch to nSuns 4 day from the 5 day variation because of time constraints, and was wondering if it's ok to swap the high volume chest (and then OHP secondary) day with main lift being OHP and secondary BB row (I don't have enough back volume as is I think).

Is that ok? Would be adding chest DB presses (incline mainly) as an accessory already.

2 - I read all the time that 95% of what matters to obtain a defined abs is the diet / bf%. Is a single exercise for the abs (like crunches or hanging leg raises, 4x12 / 2 times per week) enough to cover the remaining 5%? Or do I really need a wide variety of exercises?

 First of all, one session in the gym doesn't mean anything and it's useless to look at it in isolation. Some researchers would argue, that it takes weeks to build any kind of muscle, not days (which sounds like it's in line with the experience of most folks at the gym, especially those who are intermediate and above). Always look at lifting through the lenses of the 'long run' because that's the only way it really makes sense.

Second of all, some smart folks like Brian Minor or Eric Helms somewhat recently started describing progressive overload in a way that made a lot of sense to me as a formerly obese person, on a perpetual cut, who never bulked and gained muscle somewhat inefficiently. Progressive overload is presented as something you 'do' but in reality, it's a consequence of training. To put it in very simple terms, you get stronger because your muscles got bigger (which takes a long time) or because you've made neurological adaptations (which can be rapid at first but then slow down considerably), not because you've put 5 more lbs on the bar or you've decided to rest 30 seconds less.

This is also the reason why I prefer bodybuilding style training and rep-ranges because it's much more forgivable than the powerlifting style training. As long as you're working somewhat close to failure (0-2 reps in reserve) with an adequate volume then you can be pretty sure you're building muscle (assuming adequate nutrition and recovery). Even if you haven't increased the weight on the exercise in weeks or even months. Kai Greene does lateral raise with like 15lbs. "But, but them steroids!" doesn't really apply here because... everyone does lateral raises with a small amount of weight, and it takes months to progress on it, sometimes years. Does this mean the exercise is useless? Why does everyone with good shoulders do it then? And why do so many people think it's essential? Because, again, as long as you're close enough to failure and you're eating right, you'll build muscle.

I feel like your confusion stems from the fact, that powerlifting style training became so popular in recent years. There are no two ways about it, if you want to get stronger you need to put more weight on the bar. Not every session perhaps, but as often as you can. This is somewhat true for building muscle as well (especially when it comes to compound movements) but much less so. When you mostly care about hypertrophy, the main focus should be intensity and volume. Progressive overload is more of a gauge, you need to look at from time to time to make sure the progress occurs.

<td>Comment contains lift: 
 I made this comment on a different thread but it's also relevant here.

Here's how i do it. First some nomenclature

- `S x R x W`: `S` sets, of `R` reps with `W` weight.

- `AMRAP`: As Many Reps As Possible

- `x RM`: `x` Repetition (rep) maximum, how much weight can you do for `x` repetitions. Usually people will know their 1, 3, 5 and maybe even 2 and 8 RM.

- `EMOM`: Every Minute On the Minute, you do the exercise at every minute, this doesn't mean you get to rest 1 minute, you put the bar down and go every 1 minute (it's hard in practice to adhere to but it's what you strive for)

##### Double progression

When you can consistently complete all `R` reps across all `S` sets with your `W` weight, you increase it by a given amount. The amount depends on the lift and how easy the sets felt to you.

##### Increased calculated 1 RM via AMRAP

If you have a heavy AMRAP set and you set a new calculated 1 RM you increase the weight. Also depends on how easy it was and the exercise. 

##### Test set

If you have a dedicated top set whose purpose is to guide your progression in some way, then you increase/decrease the weight depending on your performance. Again, the exercise you do, what programme you're doing and how well you performed will dictate how much you increase the weight by.

##### EMOM test

Similar to *Double Progression*, but you have a minum number of sets with a minimum number of reps at a given weight as a target that you want to achieve. If you manage to do so you increase the weight.

##### Time

For isometrics this is the same as *Double Progression* but instead of reps it's time. I do this with grip training and some calisthenics holds.

##### Form improvements/harder progression

Similar to double progression but more general. Sometimes progress comes not in the form of increased time or weight, but on refining technique. I use this if i plateau for a bit, particularly on hard calisthenics skills/holds. I try harder progressions or improve my form. Often I can't complete all sets like this but i try to improve every cycle.

##### More sets

Add more sets.

### Conclusion

Go to the wiki and pick a beginner programme. They usually tell you how long to rest, how to progress and what exercises to do. In time you can start adding things and customising your plan.

In terms of strength, isometric only cause a significant increase in strength within a few degrees of the trained joint angle.  
  
If you want to handle more weight, within a weight envelope, in the rack position, then an isometric is ideal as it will net very little size but a shit load of strength in the rack position

 As a weightlifter, I do front rack holds anywhere from 100%-120% of my best front squat for as long as I can. They develop my ability to stay tight, breathe properly, and not be a pussy. I also get some core work out of it. 

They were also useful for getting front rack mobility. I don't think they do much for developing the upper back.

 It's far from the same as rows or pull ups, those mainly work the traps and lats while a front squat hold trains your spinal erectors of your upper back and your core. It's a great exercise to improve your back for squats and deadlifts, but in a different way.

I get a lot out of them. I just hate doing them because it's fucking hard lol.

 I used to do front rack holds for time, they have some effect on the upper back. But it mainly taxes your core, to the point i was very shaky after 30s-1 min depending on the weight. The best upper back builder would probably be heavy snatch grip high pulls. Snatch grip block deadlifts work well too and help eliminate the technical difficulties of oly lifting. Arched back good mornings with a safety bar are classic powerlifter exercise for it as well.

 I used heavy front rack holds to improve positioning and elbow Height in my Clean and jerk for a long time, but as far as being on par with dynamic exercises for putting on mass, I would stay away from them. It’s a pretty sport specific tool for weightlifters, so I think there’s definitely better ways to build out the upper back. To sum up, they work in the way their supposed to, but as far as hypertrophy in the upper back, I’d say not worth it

 Can’t answer your question based from experience but I would guess that exercise is more beneficial to high level athletes on a specific movement. 

I’d say generally you’d get more strength progression doing the common back exercises. That being said if you want to give that a try go for it. It’s not always about being optimal it’s about doing things you find enjoyable and you could still progress so why not

No. If you’re lifting to look good (and there’s nothing wrong with that, for the record!) then there are much better exercises for you.

 It might help a bit with your upper back growth (and core strength) but you should know that this exercise is mostly done for sport specific reasons. If you mostly care about growing a bigger upper back just do the standard exercises such as face pulls, shrugs and rows.

 Front rack holds are good for getting mobility and core strength and spinal strength, but as an upper back growing exercise no.. they do affect my back though, but mainly with stabilization and alignment. They hit my thoracic spine real good from forcing me to lift my chest and raise the elbows. In that regard theyre therapeutic and useful for addressing imbalances, so with upper back if youve got imbalances of the upper back then you'll definitely feel it. In that regard they will make you stronger, and grow it, up until a point in which you are balanced, aligned, in good form and mobile, but i dont see them being real significant past that point.. with me for instance, i have a harder time elevating my right elbow for the front rack than with my left, the mobility of right and left sides are uneven, and with that i have a harder time lifting the right side of my chest than my left, so i have mildly imbalanced thoracic extension. So front rack holds for time are incredibly useful for me as they force me to intensely concentrate being even and aligned and balanced.

<td>Comment contains deadlifts: 
 Isometrics in general cant produce the same amount of stress as contracting the muscle. Atleast not without the extreme fatigue of the axial loading. Much better off even doing very high volume face pulls. That being said, i use front squats and snatch-grip deadlifts as lower body exercises for people looking to emphasize upper body training and just maintain leg size. They will def add to the yolk and upper back mass to a great degree, but just generate to much fatigue to be the main drivers of upper back volume. Hope this helps!

4 sets of Pull Ups or Chin Ups (8-15 reps)

3 sets of One Arm Dumbbell Rows (8-15 reps)

3 sets of Incline Dumbbell Rows (8-15 reps)

4 sets of Farmers Walk for 30-90 seconds each lap

 Hi, I recently found out that I was over-arching my back (to prevent rounding) on my deadlifts and that I wasn't bracing properly. This wasn't a problem until recently when I decided to stop using my weightlifting belt. I developed lower back pain because of my poor bracing technique. My question is, would it be a good idea to regress to trap bar deadlifts to practice proper bracing with a decent amount of weight? Or should I just go back to deadlifting 135 lbs on a straight bar while practicing proper bracing?

Edit: Here's the [video](https://i.imgur.com/Hs2fSny.mp4) where I started feeling lower back pain from deadlifts. A lot of people that I asked in chatrooms and other forums said I had proper form but there was one guy on r/weightroom that said I was overarching my lumbar spine.

 So the gyms in my city opened up around 2 months ago and I thought I would get back into it and take it a little more seriously, before quarantine I did workout for about a year but my diet was horrible and my workouts were half-assed. I'm still weak, only a 100lb bench for like 6reps as a 5'10 165lb guy I know..a little sad..but in these 2 months I've actually surpassed my lifts (even though its only by 5 pounds) from when I did work out and I think that's good. Anyways I wanted to know what you guys thought about [my workout split.](https://imgur.com/a/4MP13HT) I made it myself and the exercises are a combination of what I read and watched online but I'm not even sure if it's optimal or even a good split. Recently, I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv7dtBT4MF4) and he suggests a mix between Upper/Lower and PPL if you workout 5 days a week. I feel like this split is probably better overall but I'm not sure, do you guys think I should switch to that? I know the general rule here is to stick with a split for a while and see what happens but I feel like that's for splits that are actually good which mine probably isnt.. Sorry for the long comment, but any help is appreciated.

But all he does is hand balancing stuff and plyometrics. He always places his cellphone on the ground below his head and watches videos while doing handstands and other hand balancing stuff.

 My week back after the deload has been mixed. 

My chest days have been amazing. Bench had felt so much nicer and I've managed to add a solid 7.5kg on it this week. I'm thinking the rest has helped me sort out my form since before I was barely making progress on it. Although today was annoying. Was working on 5 reps a set, and I was on my 4th. Suddenly this random guy came running over to spot me. Like I appreciate it but him suddenly spotting me really threw me off and messed up my final rep. I did another set alone and managed my 5 reps with ease. 

My leg days though. Oh god. Maybe it's because I delayed doing it for another week on top of the deload. Or I didnt warm up or stretch enough. But I felt so incredibly sick after my first set. Like I honestly thought I was about to be sick. I managed 3 out of 5 sets before i had to call it. I couldve done the other 2 but I didnt want to risk passing out or actually being sick. In my defence though, the strength was there. On my previous session I only managed 3x3 at that weight, so 3x5 is an improvement but I wouldve liked to finish all my sets. Next time though

 Had my first workout in 6 months after my gym closed, lost about 30-40lbs too and basically all strength I ever had (was going gym regularly prior). Tested my maxes Wednesday and probably lost about 90lbs on bench, at least 100 (probably closer to 130 to be honest) squats and didn't even bother checking deadlift. Surprisingly, my maxes on accessories didn't drop that much but that's not really any of my concern. Overall, very humbling struggling with 85lb bench when I used to laugh at that during my warmups.

 Did deadlifts for the first time yesterday and managed to do 40kg 4x8-12 but I have seen slot of people do deadlifts in much lower rep ranges like 5 reps or something. Anybody know what would be better to build muscle and strength? 5 or 12 reps? And should I use the same set/rep ranges for Benchpress and squats?

 If you're fatiguing your legs in daily life, I think it's ok if you don't push super heavy weight on leg day. You can certainly grow your legs workout pushing your limits on the compound lifts. Hypertrophy is hypertrophy no matter how you get there.

 Does Judo and work tax your upper body lifts too? What I’m getting at is if you switched the order of your split then that might help. However if you just feel overall too taxed then that won’t work.

 They probably wont get bigger. Try 3 exercises of body weight single leg exercises for 5 reps with 4 second eccentrics once a week when your legs are feeling best and most rested once a week.

Skater squats
Bulgarian split squat
Cossack squat

Stretch to remove that lactic acid buildup for better recovery too. 

Ideally elite athletes train 3-4 hours per day so youll have to develop strength to keep pushing even if it hurts until it doesnt ...

 You may need to up your calorie/carb intake, it seems that you are running out of fuel which makes sense since you're working full time, lifting, and doing judo. If you want to continue at that rate, you will need to eat more and/or lay off the judo and other heavy cardiovascular exercises on your leg days. Before you go into the gym for legs, make sure you eat a carb-heavy meal a little bit before. Also, be aware that you don't need to lift at max every week, you can make great gains in your legs by adding in plyos or increase your reps to 8-10 and maintaining slow and controlled movements. You also may be in need of a recovery week as well, if it has been about 6 weeks since you started that program, lower your weights the whole week and work at about 60% your max.  

Give yourself at least one to 2 days a week to recover or like me do PPL break PPL break, you will still get the same gains without killing yourself. On off days, you can do active recovery like stretching, abs, walking, or even some judo. Listen to your body though, you are very active and you need to make sure that you're giving your body what it needs in terms of food and recovery. Good Luck!

P.s if you're cutting, you will have more difficulty because you're calorie depleted all the time, if that's the case please don't overdo it. When I am cutting, I primarily do LISS cardio because its easier on the body

 I'd try doing squats without weights and staying within the bottom half of the range of motion. Dont stand up much higher than having ur legs parallel  with the floor, you'll  feel where it burns. Keep those muscles under tension for as long as you can. Also go very slow through the movement.  Your legs will be shaking in no time and itll help you squat heavier weights. Also do negatives  as well in the bottom half of the range of motion. Meaning like a horse stance for as long as you can hold it until you slowly start to go down. 

Your muscles in that range of motion are weak. You may be on your feet all day but how many times do you actually  bend down into a full squat position? not many I bet.  Try  doing 200 squats every day as soon as you wake up. Most people dont come close to using the full range of motion of their legs in day to day activities and are actually quite weak in the bottom half of the range of motion. There is a reason why the saying friends dont let friends skip leg day exists. Also see how many body weight squats you can do with good form and not bouncing up off the bottom using momentum to cheat up  doesnt help.

Get your 200 body weight squats done as soon as you wake up and before you know it you'll be lifting heavier. Also really stretch your legs out, if your watching tv or whatever spend  some time stretching  them any which way. I'll spend a minimum 20 minutes a day just stretching them and it does wonders. You'll feel stronger and looser.  Try stretching them out  alot for the next week along with a pile of body weight  squats and you'll notice a difference when squatting with weights. When your playing on your phone in bed stick ur legs up like your doing the splits with one foot touching the wall and the other hanging off the bed and just lay there. 

With my job I have to lift steal objects onto pallets or trucks or whatever and some days I move a ridiculous amount of steal, like alot. I'm not a big guy by any means but the legs are capable  of an incredible  amount of work and it really does help stretching them

Hypertrophy training doesnt require super heavy weights, its not strength training. High reps will build muscle and help you lift heavier weights. Of course as you get stronger lift heavier with less reps but still make sure you're doing enough reps

 I made CAP3 better for me.

I removed added weight on top of percentages and instead came up with a better RPE and rep-based formula to calculate intensities. It's working really nicely, it has me progressing faster than before on all my main lifts, calisthenics and accessories plust it doesn't leave me so beat up.

I made it with a tool I created for designing and analysing [programmes](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/Lifting.jl). Here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Z3WaoJa5iBY3u3AKfELo-h7y3Ty0EisSJ3uZK-4DWw/edit?usp=sharing) to the spreadsheet.

 i'm quite happy with Strong, however the subscription is a bit expensive (have 5 months left in the anual subscription) and I keep getting confused between the previous values for the lift and the current ones I will be doing for the session. 

Anyway, started looking for alternatives, something simple with good Apple watch integration and so far [Liftin'](https://liftinapp.co) looks okay. I'll see how it goes when my subscription ends.

Also, anybody has a good excel template for keeping track? If I keep changing app, my progress starts from 0, so I would rather have a recordings history in an excel sheet.

 I've been on a bulk the last couple of months, but I feel the progress this last month has stopped showing, I feel my chest is less defined and arms the same, the pictures were taken at the same time, the morning after my last day of a 5-day routine: https://i.imgur.com/UxPAPI9.png

I'm eating 3k calories per day, doing a clean bulk, bf around 18% in the first pic (don't know in the last one, but I assume it's the same or a bit less). What should I do? Increasing the weight isn't an option (gyms haven't opened here yet and I'm lifting all the weight I have on the 1+ on each big group, so what I'm doing is adding more reps, doing a recently modified nSuns).

Any advice? Should I stick doing the same for another month or two?

F22, \~145lbs, 5'5"

Been slowly bulking for 5 months, would like to start cutting more. Mostly weightlifting with some cardio (coming back from illness). I like that I can start to see definition at the top of my abs and in my thighs. I would like to make my thighs and abs more defined, while losing \~10lbs of fat.

Is that reasonable? Tips greatly appreciated!

Taken this morning. Stepped on the scale at 170.6lbs. Trying to bulk up from 168 about a week ago. Weight gain has been tough. Thought maintenance was around 2700, I've upped calories to 3100 but I don't think that's enough. I train 6 times a week, 2 of those days are a strong lift. The other 4 are pretty much a push, pull, leg, full split. Using apps to track those programs. Started 2020 at 185, got down to 160 and am bulking up to do another cut later. Want to know to which muscles seems to be underdeveloped (I feel like my chest is) and what does a proper physique look like?

Been cutting for around 14 weeks and thinking of tapering it off but I want to get my abs a bit more visible first. My idea is to slow the cut down (to only -250ish cals) for a couple more weeks and then start a lean bulk. Any bf estimates would help me calculate how much more I should lose.

Also in terms of lifting/my physique let me know if theres something lacking that I should pay more attention to!

Never bulked before and frankly don’t want to; have spent my whole life overweight and am terrified to put on mass now that I’ve gotten fairly lean. 

I tried to blend in flexed and relaxed pictures. I’d consider this very good lighting. No pump. 

Best way to proceed? I’ve been losing weight steadily since April but I’m still making progress (slowly) on lifts. Training regularly just over a year and started actually logging workouts and tracking volume in January. 

Also bf% estimate please!

Excuse the bad "posing" and quality. I especially suck at back posing and it's so hard to take a picture, I already suck at normal selfies.

Last 1-2 months I've focused even more on progressing on main and accessory lifts. Main focus has been the lats, hopefully progress can be seen but I reckon morning back looks way leaner compared to later in the day (glycogen store? idk). Already started incorporating some upper back volume as I think it's a lagging area.

Leg pics are missing, they got somewhat smaller as I think I've lost some fat there, but way more defined and "hard". Squats/deadlifts are going up so I don't really care tbh.

Hopefully maintained bodyfat while building some muscle, sure feels great though. On to lean bulking now!
