<td>Comment contains strength: 
 Is this a good training split? I love strength training AND running so it’s hard to fit both in.

Monday- running (usually 5 miles, walking and sprinting some if tired towards the end)

Tuesday: legs
 
Wednesday: upper body, more back than chest

Thursday: cardio, running or swimming

Friday: upper body, more chest than back

Saturday: legs 

Sunday: rest

For reference I am a 20F, at about 20% bf. 5’6 and 125 lbs

 My goal is just to have abs and slim down I’m 5’8 158lbs. For the past month I’ve been doing those YouTube 30 mins hiit exercises and eating at a deficit.  I’m just not sure if it’s appropriate ideally I would hit the gym for weight lifting but they are closed. Anyone have any tips/advice

 Hi guys,before i hammer you with questions, i just show you how my current plan is and what i want to change to help me eliminate my weaknesses. (Original GZCL programm)

Week 1

* Monday

T1 = Benchpress 3x5 @ 85%

T2 = Highbar Squats 3x8

T3 = Close grip BenchpressT3 = Split SquatsT3 = Hammer Curls

This is repeated for the whole week with the different exercises. Basically my T1 lift, followed by one lift for the same muscle and 1 or 2 lifts for a different muscle group endig with an isolation exercise.

The only thing that changes from week to week are the T1 reps/sets and percantages.

Soooo, how is this looking so far?Im not really sure what exactly the progression should look like from a workout to workout or even a "block" to "block" perspective. Im not a native english speaker, so even though i have codys book, it sometimes is a bit cumbersome to read it. The formatting i have through the amazon app is horrendous and i dont see it described anywhere in there. So if there is something i should change, please give me some pointers!

Next question would be attacking my weak points. Im absolutely awful at deads for volume/reps. For the most part of my lifting career i, at most, did 2x5 or 3x2 for deads. This is biting me hard right know.For example, my max DL is around 250kg and while the plan says i should do 212 3x5, i cant do it, not even close. First set i get 4, second only 3, you get the picture. Same for the 3x3 AMRAP the next week, 3 reps on the first set and only 2 on the second.

What i planed on doing is adding extra volume DLs to the plan on the shoulder day (which has the second back session). Seems that like a reasonable plan for fixing my god awful condition of volume DLs?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Besides that, what is your approach to cutting? Its long overdue for me to start a cut or atleast a "recomp" but i have no clue what to do with my numbers. When i cant hit certain targets while in a defficit, should i just lower them some?

<td>Comment contains lifting: 
 I'd like to have you guys' feedback on my plan for the fall semester AKA the next 16 weeks.

I'm going to bulk slowly (aiming to gain one or two pounds a month).

Since my entire semester will be online, I have more flexibility with commute eliminated from my day. I'll be going to the gym 6 times a week, and doing cardio everyday.

For lifting, I'm thinking about the 5/3/1 BBB program. I'm past the beginner phase (I can't linearly progress every day/week anymore at all). Since the 5/3/1 program is 4 days a week, I was thinking about doing a U/L/U/L/U/L/R split, essentially adding an extra upper and lower day where I'll work on accessories.

This is the part where I'm not sure.

For cardio, I have access to a pool (a building pool of unknown length unfortunately) and a rower machine.

I want to do a beginner swimming program (like 0 to 1 mile) **and** a beginner rowing program.

Is it too much? I was thinking about finding two programs that are both 3 days a week and alternate them.



Thanks in advance for your input guys.

 Do y'all think 3 sets of deadlifts a week (1 per gym day, taken as close to failure as I can without breaking form) are enough to progress? Been doing a total of 5 weekly sets but I get terrible acid reflux and my workouts go to shit afterwards, so I wanna try spreading them out more.

 What would be the best day to add additional trap work to the Arnold split?

For those unfamiliar the split is chest/back, shoulders/arms, legs.

 Just eat anything to be honest. There's no real need to eat a specific food but I usually get the munchies after a 1.5h workout so I opt for something in line with my diet to get back some calories like a Banana and some nuts.

Also I feel like the amount of coffeine can really impact the effect of your pre workout probably not in strength gains but in perception (i.e. feeling hyped up) I don't really feel you get the maximal potential out of a single coffe let alone a greentea .

<tr>
<td>Comment contains strength: 
 The amount of caffeine you take pre workout absolutely matters. In fact, an ergogenic effect on strength is only evident after taking 3x body weight in milligrams of caffeine. Post workout- doesn’t really matter. As long as you getting carbs + protein somewhere before or after your workout you are fine.

Edit: 3-6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight

 Beautiful car, and dirt cheap to buy.

If you buy one, you need to have deep pockets for repair bills.  They are very complex cars, and have very expensive parts.  To pay 3-5 grand a year in maintenance wouldn't be unusual.  I used to work at VW/Audi, and although I love those cars, I would never own one because of the upkeep costs.

<td>Comment contains strengthening: 
 My left knee is feeling good today. My right knee is killing me. Pretty sure I fucked up something doing split squats the other day.

It occurred to me that the split squats I've been doing for rehab are a *lot* more weight than I thought. I was doing it with a 25 lb curl bar thinking thats not much, but since a split squat is all one leg, that's basically twice the force. Probably not exactly, I probably use the back leg a bit, and it's nice to not put all the strain on my core, but that would explain why I feel so sore afterwards.

Waiting impatiently for my fitness bands. I've seen a lot of improvements after adding clamshells to my rehab routine for my knees, but I see a lot of  PT guides suggesting banded monster walks for strengthening hip stabilizers. I'm pretty sure my knee pain is a result of insufficient stabilization after an ankle injury (got run over), and targeted stretches on the IT band and hip flexors have already helped tremendously. Just need a bit more and *maybe* I can put my chronic leg pain behind me. I'd love to get back into running and work towards my ultimate goal of doing a Spartan Beast.

 Today was perhaps the worst squat day I ever had. I am relatively new to training back squats but I had previously squatted 225 for 3-4 reps on several occasions as a soft max of sorts.

When I worked up to that weight, I just couldn’t handle it for whatever reason. Tried 225, crumpled under the weight half way out of the hole. Whatever - dropped down to 205 and failed AGAIN on the 3rd rep.

Embarassing and baffling. But I had just went returned from taking a break of my cut in the last few days, perhaps that can explain the difference in strength.

Hey guys, this is the workout program that I do for 2 months so far. Before this program, I trained with 5x5 for 6 months. What I want to achieve with this program is that keeping strength of my lower body in a certain level while strengthening my upper body.

Tell me what are the pros and cons of my program, what i should fix and if it is fit for my goal. Is the volume too low or high for my fitness level? Is the 3 times in a week enough for my program? and etc.

 Question about routines and cutting - which program did you find to be successful on a cut?  I’m going to start a cut for the next 16 weeks - basically 1 lb/week goal - and am also ready to start a new program in a couple weeks once I get my “gym legs” back.  I’ve never lost weight and seriously lifted at the same time - I’ve done one or the other.

Context - I get about 60-70 minutes a day for lifting, up to 5 days a week.  I looked at nSuns and PHAT, but those look like they take 90-120 min to really complete (never run them, so don’t know).  I also looked at A2S2, both the linear and the RTF - I thought about doing the second and third blocks.  5/3/1 and Think Big look awesome, but I understand Wendler and Pollack have both recommend against running these on a cut.

Any recommendations?

I am 18M and weigh 120lbs and 5'7. I just moved back into college and I am looking for some advice on my workout plan. My gym is only open at 1-hour sessions at a time but I can sign up multiple times a day. My current plan is from a coach back in high school where it focuses on muscle building and strength so lots of free weights and machines to build supporting muscles. I am lacking cardio and ab work in this plan though. My plan is during the week do one session of cardio (most likely erging because I dislike running and I rowed my 4 years in high school) then do a session of weightlifting afterward. Then on the weekends, I would do yoga and ab work with Wednesday being my rest day. I am just looking for advice/thoughts on how I could better execute and advice on the workouts in general. I also need help with what workouts to do during the cardio session and Ill post the strength training below. Any help would be greatly appreciated in my path to gains!

 A question about alcohol and when to drink in order to minimize negative effects


So I’m running an UL UL split as follows: 

Sunday - off, Monday - Upper, Tuesday - Lower, Wednesday - off, Thursday - Upper, Friday - Lower, Saturday - off

I usually drink on Saturday’s each week with my mates and we all get pretty drunk. I’m well aware of how it negatively effects muscle protein synthesis and reduces testosterone/growth hormone. I recently realized that drinking the day after lifting is still bad even though it’s an off day because the recovery process is mainly within the first 48 hours. I am considering changing my split so that it looks like this:

Sunday - Upper, Monday - Lower, Tuesday - Off, Wednesday - Upper, Thursday - Lower, Friday - off, Saturday - off

I usually lift in the evenings so I’m not worried about a hangover affecting my lifting capability. Any thoughts?

 Is it normal when cutting or gaining to look worse during the middle phase of it? When I bulk there’s a certain “sweet spot” where I don’t look too flabby, and pretty solid. Now that I’m cutting I look like I don’t even lift.

 around .8g per lb of lean body mass (at 0% body fat). so if you're trying to be at 150 lbs and 10% body fat, that is a minimum of 108g protein. unless you're on anabolics and lifting double sessions 6 days per week, 1g per lb of total body mass is completely unnecessary.

<tr>
<td>Comment contains lifter: 
 A meta-analysis of 49 different studies showed that the muscle building benefits of protein greatly plateau after about 0.7-0.8g per pound of bodyweight, or around 1g per pound of lean body mass. Unless you are a very experienced or enhanced lifter, you are probably fine just sticking with the 0.7-0.8 figure.

 This is purely anecdotal, but I've been lifting and training martial arts regularly since 2008. For most of it I never had a body composition I liked. My lowest body fat percentage achieved when I was trying to figure all this out by myself in terms of macros was 18%. Trying to train and gain clean mass is hard. And in my experience you'll only feel good about the weight you put on when you are eating more protein. I'm 5'7 and average around 195-205 pounds. On my high activity days I eat 230g, low activity days I'm eating 210, and this is where I feel best. I generally don't feel strong or recover well when I eat below 170. I would suggest you try 180g for a few weeks and see how your muscles feel. Considering you are 5'9, your frame can handle it so long as you're eating lean meat. The biggest mistake a lot of people make when they eat on a surplus to gain is too much fat and bad carbs.

 &gt; If you’re of healthy weight, active, and wish to build muscle, aim for 1.6–2.4 g/kg (0.73–1.10 g/lb). Intakes as high as 3.3 g/kg may help experienced lifters minimize fat gain when bulking.

<td>Comment contains strengthening: 
 I injured a left chest muscle a while ago, and took a break from doing most chest exercises altogether. After a while, my right chest became noticeably bigger just because I was using it more in compound exercises and everyday life.

Now that I’m back at it, I’m having a lot of trouble on the left side. When I use a pec deck, for example, (I’m still doing more machines than free weights, I’m a little scared to jump right back into free weights tbh) I notice that my shoulder and arm get much more fatigued on my left than on my right side. In other words, it seems like I’m primarily using my shoulder and arm muscles on the left instead of my chest muscles.

I’ve tried doing exercises with only my left side and had generally the same results. I think that since I stopped using my chest, but kept strengthening my shoulders and arms, they’re now strong enough to just take over for my weakened chest.

I don’t really know how to get back to normal. It seems like everything I’m doing is just strengthening my shoulder, which will make me even more lopsided. Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks.

 I injured a left chest muscle a while ago, and took a break from doing most chest exercises altogether. After a while, my right chest became noticeably bigger just because I was using it more in compound exercises and everyday life.

Now that I’m back at it, I’m having a lot of trouble on the left side. When I use a pec deck, for example, (I’m still doing more machines than free weights, I’m a little scared to jump right back into free weights tbh) I notice that my shoulder and arm get much more fatigued on my left than on my right side.

 Newcomer to this sub, I've been lifting with dumbbells (all I have access to atm) and was wondering if there was a major difference in lifting progressive weight with diminishing reps (say 12x 35lbs 10x 40lbs 8x 45lbs and 6x 50lbs) vs. doing multiple rounds of the same reps with the same weight (4x (12x 40lbs). Just trying to get the most bang for my buck rep-wise, if there is a difference.

 Alright ladies and gentlemen, this might be a moderately long post, however, I'm in dire need of input. On the one side, we have John Meadows' programs, which I have tried running, but get absolutely trashed after 2-3 weeks, and on the other side we have the rep/set/load week to week build up from Renaissance Periodization. 

I am currently running RP Templates, however, my friend who has been lifting for less time than me, is generally more athletic in background and better built genetically, who is also stronger-ish than me on most movements, completely throws off the RP training style and is a John Meadows disciple. He's forcing me almost to run the Warlock Program which I've seen has most sets at RPE 9 week to week, just short of the maximum recoverable volume for most people (e.g. 17 sets for chest, 17 sets for back, 15 sets quads). 

My question to you oh so numerous and experienced redditors is: Am I missing out on something here, is one or the other flat out wrong or better, what is your experience with training approaches such as these? Thank you?

TL;DR John Meadows approach/ Renaissance Periodization approach

 I’m in my early 30s, trying to build some muscle and improve cardiovascular health at the same time. I’m 5ft 10, about 158lbs. My primary goal is to build muscle but I also value cardio health. I’ve been roughly following the PPL routine. Monday is push plus squats. Tuesday is pull. Wednesday is a fasting day, with no lifting. Thursday is push, and Friday is pull day with deadlifts. Saturday’s I’ll sometimes do some extra chest and/or legs. 

How can I maximize cardio with that schedule?

I have been doing a pretty slow mile jog up lots of hills in my neighborhood before lifting in early morning hours. Tuesday and Fridays or Saturdays I have been running hill sprints as a form of HIIT in the afternoons. And for the past few weeks, I’ve been running a slow 5k on my rest/fasting day on Wednesdays. 

I try to intersperse some leisurely walks through out my day, about 2 miles total. 

I don’t really enjoy any of the running. I’m naturally inclined toward sprinting so I dislike it less, but having ran a 5k for the first time a few weeks ago feels good to have accomplished too.

 My dudes, how do I proceed with squat progress while engaging in marathon training? I've been looking at the Smarathlov program so far, but I'm really plateauing just at week 5. It's like I need to avoid running for 3-4 days to squat at peak strength, which isn't viable with both my running and lifting schedules on the program. (Been lifting consistently for 5 years, but have taken up running seriously in the last 8 months alongside it - which is when my squat numbers started nosediving).

Stuff like stress levels, and sleep are consistent and under control. Diet has really cleaned up in the last two years too, but I'm eating to surplus and fulfiling my macros. How can I push my recovery just a tad further to undertake both hobbies without frying out?

You see guys like Nick Bare managing to juggle a powerbuilding program and endurance competitions, and maybe I'm a bit too naiive, but I really hope it's not just courtesy of juicing.

 Yes a more efficient heart and lungs will benefit you in all forms of physical activity, running will strengthen your legs and core mostly so the full benefits of running will not directly transfer to say rowing for example, you may reach muscular exhausting rowing before you reach cardiovascular exhaustion because your cardiovascular endurance is higher due to your running but the muscles engaged during rowing are not as trained as your legs are.

Does this make sense?

 It won't be 1:1, but yes: It's more complex a system than "Cardio works your heart and lungs," but  there's some truth to that. Running works long-twitch muscles in your soleus, glutes, core, etc. but it also improves the efficiency of your circulatory system which will help in just about every physical activity. Hell: \*RESTING\* after a heavy lift can be taxing on your circulatory system.

 I'm probably late to this so I don't know if anyone will see my rant or not, but

I came to this subreddit just to rant about this, and I'm glad I saw your post. To answer, yes cardio is extremely important and will make you much better at other, "non-cardio" physical activities

I feel like 2 years of my progress have been severely hindered due to lack of cardio. I started off as severely underweight; and literally every online guide, every trainer, every everything said I should eat a lot, lift a lot. And I did. And I made gains. I went from 49kg to 80kg in these 2 years, about 15kg\~ of muscle mass and 15kg of fat mass. I was given the impression that cardio was only effectively used for burning calories, losing fat, and warming up.

So I did absolutely zero cardio, and I got to a point where one heavy squat would leave me so breathless I couldn't really continue the reps, even though my muscles were fine. I'd get dizzy and nauseous and thought that's what squatting was supposed to feel like - I only realized there was a problem when I tried diving and found out I couldn't even hold my breath for 25 seconds under water while every other semi-trained person was doing 1-2 minutes.

Of course overweight people are recommended to start with cardio which will in turn help their lifting later on. But for everyone who started at an anorexic weight as I did is recommended to just eat and lift and in hindsight, that's a very bad fucking idea. If I could start all over again, I'd eat like a monster and just run for the first 3 months of trying to transform until I could at least run 4km at an above average time. Then I'd start heavy lifting, while maintaining cardio on rest days. I don't know why people seem to believe cardio is bad for bulking, it only allows you to eat even more and makes your metabolism more efficient. It might not be the best thing for 100% pure muscle gain, but in the long run it will lead to more muscle gains because you'll be healthier, energetic, and you'll be able to use your muscles much much much more efficiently in the gym. 

There is nothing worse than not being able to finish a set simply because you're fucking out of breathe

Also, on an unrelated note, fuck the whole bulking/cutting cycle. It took me 2 years to gain 15kg of muscle, but now I have 15kg of fat that will take 3-6 months of starvation to get rid of, alongside with 1kg of muscle or so

I'd get dizzy and nauseous and thought that's what squatting was supposed to feel like - I only realized there was a problem when I tried diving and found out I couldn't even hold my breath for 25 seconds under water while every other semi-trained person was doing 1-2 minutes.

Of course overweight people are recommended to start with cardio which will in turn help their lifting later on. But for everyone who started at an anorexic weight as I did is recommended to just eat and lift and in hindsight, that's a very bad fucking idea. If I could start all over again, I'd eat like a monster and just run for the first 3 months of trying to transform until I could at least run 4km at an above average time. Then I'd start heavy lifting, while maintaining cardio on rest days. I don't know why people seem to believe cardio is bad for bulking, it only allows you to eat even more and makes your metabolism more efficient. It might not be the best thing for 100% pure muscle gain, but in the long run it will lead to more muscle gains because you'll be healthier, energetic, and you'll be able to use your muscles much much much more efficiently in the gym. 

There is nothing worse than not being able to finish a set simply because you're fucking out of breathe

Also, on an unrelated note, fuck the whole bulking/cutting cycle. It took me 2 years to gain 15kg of muscle, but now I have 15kg of fat that will take 3-6 months of starvation to get rid of, alongside with 1kg of muscle or so

 For sure, yeah.

The more different kinds of physical activities that you do, the better.

I started off weightlifting and got up to bench pressing 350 pounds. It's not world-record by any means, but I sure didn't do that on the first day I started, either.

Then I was involved with martial arts and became a 5th degree, and the weightlifting helped a lot. Much more power, and didn't do the whole "muscle slows you down" bullshit.

Then I started to get into a running kick and did ultra marathons of 50 miles.

I think all of them work together.

 Running on the treadmill increases my cardio marginally. But playing football is a completely different workout. A treadmill does nothing for joints, flexibility, burst strength, etc. 

Also, the motivation in the real world pushes you a lot harder, so you get a much better workout. Time goes much faster playing sports too, so you work out for far longer.

A gym is better than nothing. The real world is better than a gym.

 It's staggering the amount of misinformation in these comments. I'm late to the party, and my comment will probably get buried, however for anyone that happens to read; this thread is a great example of why you shouldn't listen to the "wisdom" of the masses.

The answer to OP's question is pretty much a definite no. The reason for this is touched upon by some commenters, and has to do with a principle in exercise science called specificity - also known as the SAID principle. Essentially, specificity refers to the observation that the gains we make from exercise training are highly specific to that particular mode of training. Transfer of training from one mode into another is very limited and largely dependent on the extent to which the modes of training resemble each other.

OP if you want to get better at lifting and carrying heavy things, running will do nothing other than provide a placebo (more on that in a sec), unless of course you lift and carry heavy things while running. You must do these exercises in order to get better at them, or do exercises that resemble them in utilisation of muscle mechanics and energy systems. For example, farmers walks, yoke carries, deadlifts, overhead presses and other similar exercises will, when trained properly, help you with your manual labour tasks because they likely closely resemble those tasks. There will be a limit to the extent to which they transfer though.

All these people saying oh yeah, I did XYZ exercise and found an improvement in ABC task are conflating their subjective experience with genuine effect. Fatigue, for example, had a large psychological component. Every one of these anecdotes could be explained by each OP simply *believing* that they will have better performance in ABC task because they do XYZ exercise. It's more than likely placebo.

tldr: The answer to the question is no. If you want to get better at lifting and carrying stuff, then do more lifting and carrying of stuff. Look up the principle of specificity or the [SAID principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAID_principle). It's easy to know an exercise like running won't improve something so vastly different as manual labour tasks by thinking about how athletes train. Strongmen for example do a lot of lifting and carrying. I can guarantee you they don't run to get better at it.

1st was 4 reps

 So I've retested my maxes now that I've been back at the gym for a couple of days. (And that I'm about 30 pounds lighter and couldn't lift for 3 months. I went from 200 to 168 pounds)


I've lost about 50 pounds on my upper body lifts and about 100 pounds on my squats and deadlift.


My OHP was my best lift.


OHP - 200 to 175 (maybe 5 pounds more)

Bench - 335 to 275 (definitely max)

Squat - 400 to 275 (could have gone heavier, but had no safety rack or spotter)

Deadlift - 425 to 325 (no straps, I usually use straps for heavy weights)


It's a good start, I think as I slowly gain the weight back and get consistent in the gym again I'm going to come back stronger on all of the lifts.

Now after the quarantine I was just doing some simple linear progression to recoup my strength and DL was just feeling so strong I decided to try maxing out today, 180 kg came up very decent so I hit 190 kg too, so a nice 20 kg PR for me today. Definitely going to continue with 531 when I get my actual program rolling (squats are being plagued by knee/quad tendon issues).

Other minor PR was that I managed to hit a set of 5 with the heaviest dumbbells that non-powerlifting gyms tend to have (40 kg) on flat bench.

 Started lifting 3 months ago when the gyms reopened. Had a body analysis done and a trainer made a training plan for me, that i should stick to 3 days a week.

Today i had a checkup, where we redid the body analysis and adapted the workout.

Basically i put on just a little weight, but all of that was muscle mass, and i lost body fat, overall bodyfatpercentage went down.

For some reason i expected "crazy results" because i've been seriously pushing myself a lot, but i am still very very happy. It has only been 3 months and progress is definitley in the right direction. I am very proud of myself, that i build up the discipline to never skip a single workout.

I am now fueled to start the new program tomorrow morning and am highly motivated.

Should I instead just aim to maintain strength on everything as I go down in weight? Because I'm boxing as well, the gaining of strength on a deficit would be placing additional recovery demands on me, wouldnt it? Leading to greater risk of injury?

And I just barely hit 5 reps of 90% on ohp. It felt pretty damn taxing. So should I just try maintain?

 Would it be a good idea to purchase a 300lbs olympic set or get a gym membership? I am not sure if I should wait for the price to drop, so I could buy the barbell set and work out at home.

I have not been lifting for the past 6 months, so I am trying to get back to it. The current weights are fine, but certain exercises are getting harder to perform without the barbell.

I used to have the mindset that less is more when it came to food and ate 1400 calories per day. Now, I have successfully reverse dieted to be able to maintain my weight (118lbs/53.5kg) eating 2100 calories per day. I want to share my story and help others get out of the dieting mindset.

 Hi everyone my fitness blog on YouTube is EzraM619. The thumbnails with my dog in it are the most recent videos I have posted which are the ones I recommend you watch. There are bits of good information in some of the videos you can use. I use equipment and sometimes just bodyweight to condition and strength train. I have a variety of Gym equipment so as I keep posting these videos I’ll be using all the different types of equipment I have like dumbbells, kettle bells stuff like that. Some of the videos do have commentary and some special sound effects I made so I hope you enjoy. FYI I’m almost done with my bachelors degree in exercise science, I also was in the Navy for 8yrs and was a PRT coordinator, which means I got people ready for physical readiness test we had to take. These videos are more for your imagination if you get bored doing the same thing over and over. if you like what I do you can do it or maybe even modify the exercises I do to your liking either way I hope you enjoy and if you do like share and subscribe :-)

 How fast should I be gaining weight without too much of it being fat? I've been gaining weight at 3 pounds per week give or take and started off from 5'9" 125 pounds and am now at about 135 pounds in 3 weeks. (So a beginner lifter).

I don't look too different when I look in the mirror to be honest (I goofed and didn't take a before after picture). My ribs still show a bit and I still have my skinny boi abs (which I'm sure will go away as I gain more weight). But I'm just wondering if this rate of growth is unusually high or low or right on track.

I'm ok gaining a bit of fat since I figure that'll help me fill out at a reasonable level but I don't want to really get to any stage where I just straight up look flabby if that makes sense.  I've been working really hard with the Reddit PPL program and have been pushing myself to eat a lot more than before.

I'm not tracking my calories at the moment but I just figured that if I maintained 125 pounds for years, I just have to eat a significant amount more than what I ate for those years and it's been working for the most part.

But at a certain point, I assume that muscle gain should slow down and if I keep my weight gain at the same rate forever, it'll mostly be fat? What should I be looking out for you avoid that down the road and am I ok for now?

 Returned back to the gym for the first time in 6 months. I'm impressed with all the social distancing and cleaning going on, and I felt quite safe (safer than being in the supermarket).

I was impressed with my cardio. Hadn't done the spin bike, but ramped up my running and circuit training in these 6 months but was able to do 40 minutes on it without difficulty. 150bpm, felt quite calm.

I was less impressed with my strength. Did back and arms and I've essentially lost half my strength. Numbers were all down by half. 

Felt good being back though and I'm looking forward to a new challenge.

 Struck a deal with the owner of my gym. They open at 5am but on Mondays, Wednesday’s, and Saturdays I can get there at 4am and have the place to myself for an hour. I get up at 3:15, do a little warm up at home, get to the gym right at 4, lift until a little before 5, finish with a run around the lake behind my house, and get my full workout in without seeing anyone.

 A girl at the gym asked me to spot her bench. I had been watching her quarter rep and half rep some sets before this. I could tell she was ego lifting a bit and I was so tempted to say something. I kept my mouth shut and gave her a couple spots and tried to be encouraging after each attempt. 

On the last set she brought up that she worries about letting the bar go lower and she needs to work on it. I agreed that getting the bar low can be a little scary but if she drops the weight pretty low then she can practice it without the fear of failure and slowly add weight back up. She agreed to try it on her next bench day. 

I feel like if I'd said something right away she would have ignored the advice and potentially hurt herself. Hopefully now she works on it and hits that 1 plate rep she attempted with good form

 Two regulars who workout the same time as me, who are mostly doing upper body work and not as much lower body/legs were doing squats next to me.

After their sets, one of the guys stopped up to look at me doing my sets and, quietly through my headphones I could hear the he told his friend "See man, I want to be able to do that as well!"

That was a nice little uplifting feeling in my sets 💪

 I love deadlifts. I do not love the lake of sweat that appears on the floor that my towel never seems to fully able to soak up.


Feels extra bad when I go get extra paper towels to dry it up and someone has already taken the bar and is standing in the sweat puddle.

 I've just moved from one gym to another. Same chain but different site. They have the the same cable machines but I swear they are all labelled in pounds rather than kg. If. It it means I'm lifting literally double, which is definitely not the case! So confusing why they did this. Kg for life!

 It's has been 5 months without gym and training from home, now i had to stop for some days due to a shoulder injury that came back (almost sure it's tendinitis) and i realized that it's useless to pursue my initial goal in this circumstances thinking that there will be no vaccine until the end of the year or the beginning of the next.

I wanted to gain weight to build muscle but without more added weights to lift or not having enough food to reach 3,300 calories, I gave up: i'm just gonna cut. I have a good jump rope, which I will give more time, and I will continue with the training that I have for now.

This sucks. But if i'm not gonna get big at least i'm gonna be ripped.

 Dumbells were not in correct places but I did not notice.. so I did overhead press with 2 different weights, wondering why I had a really hard time finishing my set with my left arm... Only to notice the weight difference when I dropped them to the floor. Then saw some other guys trying to figure out where the weights were too.... Please put the dumbells in their correct spot :(


Other day some dude came walking to me, asking me where his drinking bottle was.. I tried to explain that I didn't see it and joked that I did not steal it. He looked up very confused and embarrassed. I was not the guy he thought I was. (His friends was next to me on the other bench, same shirt). We laughed a good amount. These things make the solo-training  a bit better haha


And another from this week,

I was half way through my squat sets, my towel, phone and drinking bottle was at the squat rack with all the weights on the bar. Went to get a drink just to come back to a (new) guy clearing all the weights from the bar. Told him I was not done yet, but only had some sets  left and he looked really embarrassed, kind of scared like 'what have I done now', and after some hesitating he asked me if I could let him know when I was done. I remember my first time at the gym, feeling so uncomfortable. Now it's like a second home.

This week was also the first week that I went 1 rep too far on the incline bench press, not being able to lift it anymore and do the roll of shame. Nobody saw.

 One time a random guy asks me to spot him on a bench press. I say sure why not. He does a few reps and then he can't  lift the bar off his chest. I try to help him BUT I CAN'T because the weight is too heavy. I try to lift it but I'm too weak and exhausted. Gladly other two guys came to help and the guy I was spotting did not get injured. It was embarassing and also dangerous. Now I always refuse to spot random people.

The before/after format here might be a bit unusual but looking for ideas about how to continue my progress.  My long term goals are to increase strength and muscle mass, while ending up at least as lean as I currently am.

I have been lifting 2x week with a basic progressive overload program for the past 6 weeks, and cycling \~50 miles/week for the past 6 months.

The weight loss was primarily a result of tracking weight over time/adjusting diet, with some weeks of strict calorie counting in there.  At this point, I'm thinking I should not go any lighter, and have switched to a slight calorie surplus, with the idea of slowly gaining muscle mass as I continue weight training.

Please let me know if you have any advice!

Bulk or Cut? Also BF% estimates pls! I just started lifting a little less than 2 months ago, so I’m a beginner, but I need advice on whether I need to bulk to gain more muscle, or cut then build my way up. Ideally I would like to build a noticeable amount of muscle and have visible abs, which will probably take many more months. Will bulking or cutting speed this process up, or should I continue to eat at maintenance and do my usual routine, or something else? PS. I’m not very educated on fitness stuff yet, so some of that might just sound obvious and ignorant, but I’m just looking for answers on what I should do. Any advice/feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!

Been doing an unintentional cut lately. Work and trips have been keeping me busy and the hotel gyms are still closed, throwing off my lifting schedule. When I’m at home I follow a 4-day split (LPPL). The plan is to get back on my bulk for the next 6 months and try to put on at least another 5-6lbs. I think I’ll be happier with my physique in the 140s, with a little more muscle on my frame.

 M20 started gzclp 3 weeks ago. The gym I currently go doesn't have 1.25 kg plates so I can't increase by 2.5 kg on upper body lifts like I should. I bought 2 1.25 kg plates just to find out that they don't fit in the barbell at my gym. I will change gym in 3 weeks so I don't want to buy more plates. I was thinking of doing for T1 bench and Ohp one week with 5 sets for 4 reps(or 5?) Instead of 5x3 and the next week to increase by 5 kg instead. And for T2 bench and Ohp to increase by 5 kg and do 3x7 instead of 3x10 and the next week do 3x10 with the same weight. Is this a good idea? If not what would you do?

 Normal chin ups with decent TUT time under tension is getting easier for me now so I've been trying archer chin ups. I know weighted is an option but a dip belt I ordered hasn't arrived yet and I'm actually having fun trying out the archer variant.

Question: I can only manage 3-5 reps per set atm for each arm, I'm sure it's enough to build strength but is this even optimal?

Edit: I've also been doing negatives on archer chin up (I think that's what it's called) where I just start from the the top and slowly descend down.

 Im having a little trouble organizing my preferred order of training cetain muscle groups to allow for adequate rest between each session. Trying to avoid pushing motions on consectutive days (not following but basing my workouts on push/pull) however with a bit of modification. The problem I am having is ensuring i can get the volume i want without hindering recovery, if possible i'd love to train 4 days per week but i don't thinks its possible given my goals so 5 days a week is what I am look at.

Here is what I am thinkng -

Weekly session:

Chest x2
Shoulders x2
Biceps x2
Triceps x2
Forearms x2
Abdominal x2
Back x1
Legs x1


Day 1: Chest + Triceps + Abs
Day 2: Back + Biceps + Forearms
Day 3: Shoulders + Legs
Day 4: REST
Day 5: Biceps + Forearms 
Day 6: Chest + Triceps + Abs
Day 7: REST
Day 8: Shoulders + Legs
Day 9: Back + Biceps + Forearms 
Day 10: Chest + Triceps + And
Day 11: REST
Day 12: Shoulders + Legs
Day 13: Biceps + Forearms 
Day 14: REST

* NOTE I've edited the weekly routine for what I had written all my thiughts/desires and requirements for and made it into a two week routine which changes scheduling a little bit to ensure adequate rest. 

So over 2 week period, frequencies are - 
Biceps/Forearms x4
Shoulders/Legs x3 
Chest/Triceps/Abs x3
Back x2 (I'm ok with this cause main bicep movement is chin ups)

Some scheduling issues might arise if I try to flow this into day 15 etc, cause of back only being done twice possibly have to do it day 15 or 16 with biceps again without more than 48h although I think I'd just prefer to restart the whole two week cycle from the beginning. 
Rest days x4



So i'm looking at a way to structure this to hit all those groups twice per week with the willigness to scale down some isolation work and focus more on compound movements for instance not needing triceps twice per week. My goals are to increase shoulder size, specifically traps and delts. Increase chest size, increase biceps size aswell as forearms. A strong back is also a priority for me but i think one workour per week to alow ample recovery here is sufficient as I will use chin-ups on biceps days. 

A concern I have is excessive forearm work possibly causing fatigue on day 3,6 and 10 for chest and shoulder movement but we will see how this goes. Forearm strength and size is a priority for me as it's a weak point - I know that plenty of indirect work will target it but I want to be serious and intentful on achieving my results so do want direct training. 


I've been training for about 2 years inconsistently and am able to train consistently now due to health reasons. Last year I trained for 5 months straight toward the end of the year and was my most consistent period and been training again since June of this year. 
I weighed 73kg middle of last year and am now sitting at 82.5kg standing @ 6'1'' and goal is to get to 90kg with little incremental weight gains. I am bulking but not going to eat more than 3,500 on any given day although roughly 3,500 is my target but wont mind if i fall short around 3,200-3,300 so long as my protein intake is around 180-190g.

Cheers for any advice guys

Working out is entirely new to me. The gym is new to me. And the equipment looks very complicated and I'm unfamiliar with it. 

I'm very interested in doing weightlifting. But I'm lost in knowing where to start.

I'm very anxious going into gyms since I might look stupid using the wrong equipment, and I have no one in my life that is doing body-building, so I'm doing this alone... So this is going to be a challenge for me. Hoping I can get some responses and advice from you guys!

 Should you still expect to progress on your lift numbers while cutting? For example, if I'm trying to cut from 155 lbs down to 145 lbs at 2lbs a week, that would put me at 5 weeks.

 I'm running 5/3/1, really liking it so far. Making good progress.

For assistance work, I do big muscles (5x10 of the major compound of the day + lat pulldowns/pull ups, etc..)

Most often, I also do 5x10 @50% of an other compound as well to add some volume. So e.g military press on deadlift days, squats on bench days.

  


Is that a good idea? Or would it better to some dumbbell assistance work in stead of the compound lift muscle group?

I miss the deep focus as you take mental inventories of all your muscles and cues that you've built up over time when you're about to drop into a squat or brace for a deadlift.

I miss my pants feeling a little more snug in the seat and thighs. I miss my t-shirts subtly stretching across my torso because my back fills them up.

I run and bike 3-5 times a week now. It's not the same.

 I’m really struggling to get my routines and habits back after quarantine. Yesterday I cried at the gym because I couldn’t get the fucking weights off the ground. It was close to my max deadlift, but I was just being too hard on myself. Anyway, starting counseling on Friday.... Don’t neglect your emotional gains, friends.

 First time really tweaking my lower back last week, over arched during bench then did deadlifts right after knowing my back wasn't right. Lower back pain is a lot scarier than I thought it would be.

 I'm on Week 2 of being back into training, and my lower back is my limiting factor. 

I'm still able to squat 4 plates, but now my lower back is killing me. I've been lifting for almost 7 years so I know what doms should feel like, but this just feels like an injury instead. 

This week I was meant to do 205kg for 5x5, but now I've reset my program to lower the squats to 100kg which feels ridiculously easy all because I need to build up my lower back strength again. 

In a way it's good, because now it'll teach me to be cautious in my training so that I can continue to lift even when I'm 50 and 60.

 My gym has never been great with social media or updating their website. I never cared until now. I’m hopeful they’ll open on Monday as my state is now allowing but their social media is dead quiet and their website has updated with a “safety page” but no actual information on if they’re opening and how things will work as a customer.

Literally everything else about this gym is great but damn it I want to know if I can lift again. I’m losing my marbles!

 When I set my weight to be able to lift 8-12 reps max, I have to lower the weight by the 3rd set or I fail before my 8th rep. Is this normal?
Should I pick my max weight so that my max rep on my last set is between 8-12 or do it the way I'm doing it? 
My goal is to gain muscle/strength.
Thank you

 I don’t know how much you lift but it’s pretty easy to just use your knees to “kick” the weights into starting position. I’ve seen people on YouTube do this with 150+ lb dumbbells so just learn how to do that instead of buying some gimmicky thing.

 I can see the practical use of these, especially if you have a prior shoulder/muscle injury; but personally I think if you require power hooks you should stick with a straight barbell if you feel the need for them, at least until you can adequately control and support the desired weight of the dumbbell you wish to lift.

 I tried these out, but found them awkward and difficult to re-rack especially on everything but flat bench press.  If you do buy a set make sure you get a good pair rated for the weight you will use and expect damage if you have to bailout on a lift(damage to the device or flooring).

 While I am exceedingly skeptical of OPs claims to be shoulder pressing 120lb dumbbells in each hand.

  Some products do exist and have merit, especially for spinlock type dumbbells or the like that OP references.

  Kick up method or cleaning can certainly become a limiting issue, as well as dropping such dumbbells is not a good idea and getting them back down safely for the weights could be unsafe for the lifter.

  Sure, sure, just go lighter and do more reps is somewhat an option, but there's no reason using such products as hooks or dumbbell J-hook attachments etc is anything but a good thing if you have access and do want to use em.

As you might have guessed, I am of very small build. My body type would be skinny fat. I lost some belly fat by dieting for last few months but I still have the love handles.

I started going to the gym for the first time in my life about a week ago. I am pretty feeble and right now just lifting the lightest weight is difficult for me. And I am having issues maintaining proper posture while lifting weights. My brain simply cannot pick up the correct movements by seeing another person. I need someone to actually grab my arms or legs and put it in  correct position for the first time.

And the trainer is not of much of help. He keeps on saying that I need to pay for a personal trainer since for general training, he is not going to correct my posture. This is already affecting my anxiety issues that kept me away from the gym for so long. 

So my question is whether I really need to pay for a personal trainer (its pretty expensive) or as a complete beginner the general trainer should help me correcting my posture? Should I change the gym?

 I'm constantly flipping between wanting to cut and wanting to bulk and need some advice. 

Stats: 6 ft (182cm), 73kg (161lbs)

I'm pretty new to lifting anddo not have much muscle. I'm aware that I am on the light side for my height, but I still have a some fat around the belly and pecs (I'd say approx 20% bodyfat). At the moment I'm eating at a slight deficit while getting 1g of prot per lb of bodyweight. I've read from multiple sources that as a relatively new lifter with little muscle, as long as I get enough protein, that I should be able to build muscle while losing the remaning fat I want?

Or is it as simple as I am too light for my height and just need to eat at a surplus? And yes I have read the wiki! Thanks.

 So I was told a while ago that drinking lots of water was meant to help lose weight and so I've been drinking 2 litres every day since around March because I've always been overweight and now that I have lots of free time because of quarantine, I'm using it to lose weight before going back to college.

I also have been only eating mostly egg based breakfasts and soups for dinner, with the occasional protein and veg meal to replace the soup maybe twice a week at most.

Issue is, I've now heard that water weight can come back very fast and with me basically being on a near all liquid diet, I don't know how badly it will impact my weight gain if I go back to regular meals.

I've been doing a decent amount of exercise, mostly out with the dog and lifting weights and am planning on doing more cardio, but like I said, I have no idea what will happen with the water weight part and don't know whether to change the diet completely when I want to try and build muscle rather than lose weight.

 Just got back into working out the past two months. How should i go about setting up a short term and long term workout regimen? Right now I’m slightly cutting/ maintaining to look decent during the summer (as douchy as that sounds lol) but ultimately I’d like to get bigger and stronger. 

I figured in the fall, when beach/ pool season are over with, I’d start a bulk and power lifting regimen to get my strength up. Run that for 6 or so months then start cutting to get ready for summer again. 

For bulking i was going to do SS or PHAT. 

For cutting i was going to do PHAT or PPL (current). 

My lifts are bench: 155 for 5, deadlift 225 for 5. I don’t really squat as i have some back issues. I really haven’t been deadlifting either. Just subbing with exercises that are a big easier on the back haha.

 Just started doing this recently. Lifted for many years previously, but back at it now! 

Upper- Monday/Thursday
Lower- Tuesday/Friday

My main 3 for Monday are Bench, OHP, and bent over barbell rows. I do 5x5 sets. I'll do 5x5 of a set weight on Day 1, if I hit all my sets, for day 2 I will add 5 lbs per side. Then of course I do accessory exercises, typically 3x8, with also progressive overload. 

My big focus is squats right now, so I do squats on both lower days. I'll start off at warm up set, add 5lbs, for sets 4 and 5, I'll decrease 5lbs. If I hit all sets, day 2 my first set (and all following ones) will be 5 lbs heavier than the respective set from day 1. Then I follow up RDL'S, sitting and standing calf raises, leg extensions, leg press. All also with progressive overload, but I consider it accessory work.

So far all my lifts are going up, so I'm satisfied. Any thoughts?

 There ain't no rules.  Do something and do it hard and do it with conviction and aim to get better each time.  Use dumbbells, use barbells, use fucking cinder blocks, who cares.

You will get to a point where you're too strong for the dumbbells you have.  So what do?  Get heavier dumbbells.  Or move onto something else, like buying a barbell and a power cage, or even lifting logs or whatever.

Quit killing yourself over trying to decide what to do and just do something.  It's like browsing Netflix for a movie to watch and never actually watching anything because you keep looking for the most perfect or better movie.

 The honest answer is that its not as optimal as a PPL program with barbells. But depending on your goals and lifestyle choices who cares? You don't need the most optimal program to get fit.

 I haven't ran that exact routine, but I've ran a dumbbell based PPL at home for the past 5 months since the gyms closed. 

I've got a pull-up bar, 2x20kg adjustable dumbbells (max on one is 32kg) and a variety of resistance bands. 
I simplified my routine, cutting down on the variety of exercises and pretty much supersetting everything for speed and extra volume. I slowly progressively overloaded and made sure to be consistent and disciplined. 

Honestly, considering I had a near breakdown when they announced gyms were closing, it's been an excellent several months. Whilst I am no doubt weaker on the big lifts, I have kept all size and dropped some BF% (slightly reduced calories, less beer, kept my cardio up), making me look much better.

Don't get me wrong, I can't wait for my gym to reopen, but I'm more than happy enough with my results with such basic equipment.

 It’s better than not training at all. If you only have access to dumbbells then you have to make do with what you have.

 Did this routine for about ten months as a beginner before transitioning to a barbell PPL program. As a beginner it did a lot for me, I started out very skinny and have since put on a good amount of muscle. If you are a beginner as well I recommend it highly, I think dumbbell routines are a great way to get started and allow a great transition to a more solid barbell PPL later on. Do keep in mind the program is more based on building hypertrophy (building muscle) instead of actually building strength, which is why I recommend transitioning to a barbell PPL at some point.

 It's totally fine in the general sense and actually pretty necessary if your goals require specificity, Olympic lifting for example. There are some benefits to changing things up. One is preventing mental burnout, that's pretty subjective. Another is periodization which I would argue is more important to competing in something more so than general aesthetic goals. Lastly switching up exercises or variations of exercises as well as rep schemes can save you some wear and tear on the joints as well as potentially bringing up some weak points.

 Referencing Mike Israetel not verbatim; this can work up to a late intermediate / advanced point wherein you need to really focus on what you want to improve.

I.e (theoretical example) this training cycle I want to get my chest bigger so everything else takes a slight backseat and you concentrate on your chest movements.

As a side not 4x8/6 for size (again love or hate mike) is not what you’re going to want to do for size you can’t get close to failure with that you would want higher rep ranges because I could guarantee from experience you can hammer yourself with these 4x &lt;10 sets but drop ~25% of the weight and do another 4 sets easily.

Again I believe this is up for dispute in the sports science world but it’s pretty well documented that sets below 10 reps will increase strength more than size and vice versa

 Without knowing anything, I would say yes.

When you use `&amp;&amp;`, you are effectively deriving a piece of state, so it becomes important to be aware of predicate functions and predicates in general. Once we establish that, you should be using Mealy finite state machines as often as possible for state, because it has implications on making your DOM markup as simple and clear as possible with respect to data flow, and how data is flowing through the component.

I would recommend pieces of state such as:

&amp;#x200B;

    const hasUsers = (props.users &amp;&amp; (props.users.length &gt; 0));

and then switch over a finite enum list of states:

&amp;#x200B;

    const allowedStates = ['INITIAL', 'LOADING', 'LOADED', 'ERROR'];
    
    // default state
    this.state = 'INITIAL';
    
    // some lifecycle method
    this.state = 'LOADING';
    this.users = fetch('http://users');
    
    if (this.hasUsers) {
        this.state = 'LOADED';
    } else {
        this.state = 'ERROR';
    }

In this way, you can see that your DOM markup in that component can only have 4 different variants, and you've fully decoupled them from the imperative logic that inter-mingles with the declarative UI and data flow.

Finite state machines allow you to think in terms of what should be on the screen when some conditions are true, and your app is therefore fundamentally simpler because you can think in terms of actions and events that lead to transitions in state and then the appearance of specific states.

All this hinges on the idea of preferring one state field: `this.state`, and then you spend most of your time thinking in terms of predicates that trigger state transitions. That is specifically how you decouple the downstream guts from the simple facts of the UI appearance. Components are created and destroyed when state changes. You free yourself from the imperative logic surrounding those state changes.

With all that said, predicates allow you to create a label and attach arbitrary logic to them in a manner that doesn't really affect the states or transitions to or from states. For example, if you add `&amp;&amp; props.timestamp &gt; now`, it's pretty clear that no weird side effects will occur with respect to physically how the state transitions.

The danger with `&amp;&amp;` is it makes the reference a compound. Compound units are more complex than single units. 2 is more complex than 1. The part I don't like about this, is you are deriving a single unit by joining multiple units. This isn't instantly dangerous, but it does have very quick bearing on cyclomatic complexity and the fact that derivation of state pieces is more implicit. Finite state machines make the current state explicit, and they also lock the states down to a finite list, so complexity is tamed, and it's impossible for components to create and render at illegal times.

The danger is when a component decides to render itself based upon a derivation of state that occurs at an illegal time due to an unforeseen path traversal through the imperative logic. For example, if `isLoaded` is evaluated as truthy for 0.1ms at the wrong time, this can have downstream implications. The worst thing you can have is some code like:

    if (this.isLoaded &amp;&amp; this.hasData &amp;&amp; !this.hasErrors)

Notice how the boolean is derived based on a complex chain of conjunctions. This is horrific compared to:

    if (this.state === 'LOADED')

The first one takes a developer longer to understand what the actual condition is, and it derives the state. The state is implicitly declared.

The second one makes it instantly obvious that it relates to the loaded state, and the state is explicitly declared. The deal with predicates is they allow you to trap behaviour down to a Boolean. This makes it easy to stack them while keeping declarative logic decoupled from the imperative logic.

Read this article to learn more. I glossed over quite a bit: [https://medium.com/@DavidKPiano/the-facetime-bug-and-the-dangers-of-implicit-state-machines-a5f0f61bdaa2](https://medium.com/@DavidKPiano/the-facetime-bug-and-the-dangers-of-implicit-state-machines-a5f0f61bdaa2)

In my example above, notice how it's physically impossible for the component to be in `'LOADED'` state without `this.users` being set. Imagine how that affects everything. You don't need to worry about illegal states and missing values if you make that potential not possible.  


With all that said, this has to do with closed for modification, open for extension. When you use finite state machines, the current states and transitions are known and explicit, and then you can easily extend components by adding new states, and therefore, the chance of introducing bugs is minimized. For example, if your component supports 5 states and you need a new one, your component now has 6 states and the first 5 still work the same.
