# About

Relevant for Reddit in it's current state is a script that pulls data from the reddit api. Future plans are to allow users the ability to tie keywords to specific subreddits. The goals is to give users the power to be notified of relevant content for subreddits that they don't frequent as often.

# Viewing the App

In it's current state the app is simply a script that authenticates with the reddit api and requires the use of secrets. At the moment there is no way to access the content.


# Built With
